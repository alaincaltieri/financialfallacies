Buying only the most popular stocks, often referred to as "herding," can be a financial fallacy due to several reasons. 

1. **Overvaluation**: Popular stocks might be overvalued, meaning you are potentially buying at a price that is higher than the company's intrinsic value [1].

2. **Lack of diversification**: Buying only popular stocks can lead to inadequate diversification. Portfolio diversification helps in reducing risk and volatility [2].

3. **Late Entry**: Popular stocks are typically ones that have already experienced substantial growth, you might be entering at a phase where there is less room for growth.

An academic study, "Behavioral Finance in the Financial Crisis: Market Efficiency, Minsky, and Keynes" elucidates the impact of herding and market bubbles [3].

The appropriate financial behavior is to do your own research, consider your own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Aim for a well-diversified portfolio and consider all types of stocks, not just the popular ones. “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” by Burton G. Malkiel suggests concepts like efficient market hypothesis and random walk theory providing insights to build a balanced portfolio [4].
