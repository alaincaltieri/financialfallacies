Buying in bulk to save money can be a financial fallacy primarily due to two reasons - wastage and unnecessary spending. If you buy more than what you initially need and end up not using it, it leads to wastage. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council found that the average American throws away $28 to $43 in the form of uneaten food each month, a significant portion of which comes from buying in bulk (Hall, 2009). 

Secondly, purchasing in bulk might lead to unnecessary spending if the product is not really needed, or if you're buying it just because it's more cost-effective in larger quantities. This can also lead to an unhealthy accumulation of debt if done repeatedly. An article by Investopedia emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between 'wants' and 'needs' while planning one's expenses (Kent, 2020).

Instead of buying in bulk, the correct financial behaviour is to buy based on your actual needs and usage. You should plan your purchases in advance and compare prices amongst different retailers to get the best deal (Dahlhoff, 2015). Also, getting a clear understanding of your consumption behaviour and refraining from impulsive purchases can go a long way in maintaining financial health.
