This statement is a financial fallacy mainly on two grounds: Opportunity Cost and Compound Interest. 

Opportunity cost refers to potential gains one could earn from an investment but misses upon choosing an alternative. In this context, if you choose not to contribute to your retirement fund, you're missing out on the potential financial growth of your investments. 

Compound interest works on the principle of generating earnings on both initial investment and its cumulative earnings. So, if you skip contributing for a year, you lose a year's worth of potential compounded growth.

The correct financial behavior would be to prioritize retirement savings while also effectively managing current expenses. The key is to balance between spending and saving while not compromising on long term financial goals.
