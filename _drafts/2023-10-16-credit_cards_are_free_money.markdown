The notion that "credit cards are free money" is a financial misconception. Credit cards are essentially a type of short-term loan that must be repaid, often with substantial interest if the balance is not paid in full each month. Major credit card companies can charge interest rates as high as 29.99%. If only minimum payments are made, the principal balance can take years or even decades to pay off due to compounding interest (Investopedia, 2020). 

Far from being 'free money', credit cards can lead to a cycle of debt if not used responsibly. With late fees, interest charges and potential penalties for exceeding your credit limit, misuse of credit cards can lead to a lower credit score, which can affect future financial opportunities, such as getting approved for a mortgage or car loan.

Correct financial behaviour involves understanding that credit cards should be used as a convenience tool and not a source of income. The best practice is to only charge what can be paid off in full each month to avoid interest charges. It's also key to budget properly, live within one's means, and save for unexpected expenses. Building an emergency fund and setting financial goals can contribute to effective personal finance management.
