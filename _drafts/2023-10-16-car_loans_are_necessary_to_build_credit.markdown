The idea that car loans are necessary to build credit is a financial fallacy because there are many other ways to build credit that don't involve such large sums of money and the potential risk of going into debt. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), you can build credit by paying your bills on time, having a mix of credit types (credit card, retail account, etc.) and applying for and opening new credit accounts only as needed (1).

Furthermore, taking out a car loan with the sole purpose of building credit may put you in a financial position where you owe more on the vehicle than it's worth, due to factors like depreciation and interest costs. This can potentially hurt your financial situation more than help it.

Therefore, the correct financial behaviour would be to consider other, less-risky methods of building credit, such as a secured credit card, paying all your existing bills on time, or getting a credit-builder loan (2). These methods, along with regular monitoring of your credit reports, can help you responsibly build your credit without taking on unnecessary debt.
