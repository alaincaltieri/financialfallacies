Penny stocks, or those trading below five dollars per share, often attract investors due to their low price and the allure of getting significant returns. However, this is a financial fallacy because penny stocks present several risks:

1. Lack of Information: Many penny stock companies are not required to submit regular financial reports, limiting transparency and making it harder for investors to make informed decisions. 
(Reference: [SEC | Penny Stocks](https://www.sec.gov/English/Article/Oiea-Investor-Alerts-Bulletins/Investor-Alerts_IA_PennyStock.html))

2. Liquidity: Penny stocks have low liquidity, which makes them difficult to buy and sell. Therefore, investors may be stuck with them for longer than they'd like.
(Reference: [Investor.gov | Risks of Penny Stocks](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-33))

3. Volatility: Penny stocks can be very volatile, leading to the potential for significant losses.
(Reference: [SEC | Understanding Penny Stocks' Risks](https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_pennystocks.pdf))

Instead of investing in penny stocks, the correct financial behavior is to invest in diversified portfolios that balance risk and reward. These can include mutual funds, ETFs, or a mix of stocks fitting the investor's financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. 

For further reading, I suggest reviewing "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel or "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham, which provide invaluable insight into investing principles.

Always remember, making informed decisions based on sound financial principles is integral to successful investing.
