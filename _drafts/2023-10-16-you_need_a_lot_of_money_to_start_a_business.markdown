The fallacy that a large sum of money is necessary to start a business is based on traditional models where start-ups needed physical spaces, inventories, and hired staff. Today, technology and the internet have made it possible to start businesses without those costs. This can be seen in the rise of e-commerce, freelance, and online service businesses (Investopedia, 2021).

Moreover, governmental agencies and organizations like the Small Business Administration in the U.S offer grants, loans and resources to help new entrepreneurs. Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe have also proven successful for raising startup capital (Schaefer, 2019).

Correct financial behavior suggests starting small and expanding gradually. Focus on developing a viable product or service first. Utilize available resources efficiently, invest in the necessary elements only, and avoid unnecessary debts. Bootstrap by making use of personal savings, or consider crowdfunding or angel investors. Validating your idea with a minimum viable product (MVP) before scaling can also reduce financial risk (Forbes, 2017).
