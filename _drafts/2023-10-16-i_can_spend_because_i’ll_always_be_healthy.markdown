The statement "I can spend because I’ll always be healthy" is a financial fallacy due to several reasons:

1. Uncertain Health Conditions: No one can predict their future health. Even the healthiest individuals can encounter unexpected health issues (Source: Life Happens, "How likely is it that you'll get sick or hurt?" - lifecare.com).

2. Medical Costs: Medical expenses can be significant and can result in financial hardship. One study found that in 2017, 137 million Americans faced financial hardship due to medical expenses (Source: American Journal of Public Health, "Medical Bankruptcy: Still Common Despite the Affordable Care Act" - ajph.aphapublications.org).

Correct Financial Behavior:

1. Emergency Savings: Establish an emergency savings fund to handle unexpected health costs.

2. Insurance: Ensure adequate health insurance coverage to limit out-of-pocket medical expenses.

3. Retirement Planning: Include potential health care costs in retirement planning.

4. Healthy Lifestyle: Adopt a healthy lifestyle to potentially lower risk of significant health issues.

5. Regular Check-ups: Regular medical check-ups can detect health issues in early stages and possibly reduce treatment costs.
