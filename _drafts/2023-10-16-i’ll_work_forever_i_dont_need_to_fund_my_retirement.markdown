The belief that you'll work forever hence not needing to save for retirement is a financial fallacy due to several reasons.

1. Uncertain Health Status: Aging introduces the risk of declining health or disability that may prevent one from working forever (OECD, 2019).

2. Unexpected job loss: The economy is cyclical and job security is never guaranteed (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, n.d.). 

3. Reduced earning potential: Advanced age may coincide with decreased energy or cognitive abilities, reducing earning potential (CRR at Boston College, 2012).

4. Longevity Risk: Life expectancy is increasing with advancements in medicine (World Bank, 2019), which implies longevity risk.

Correct Financial Behaviour:
Planning for retirement is crucial, beginning with aggressive saving and investing early in one's career. This can include contributing to employer-provided retirement plans (like 401ks and 403bs in the U.S.) and establishing individual retirement accounts (IRAs). It's also wise to diversify investments to manage risk and consider life expectancy, inflation, and potential healthcare costs when estimating required retirement savings. Additionally, consulting a financial advisor can aid in tailoring a retirement strategy suited to individual circumstances.
