It's a financial fallacy to look for the highest dividend yield because it may not always indicate a good investment. A high dividend yield could be a sign that the company is not reinvesting its profits back into its business, which could limit its growth potential. Additionally, a high yield could be due to a significant drop in the stock's price, indicating trouble within the company (Investopedia, n.d.a).

Moreover, dividends are not guaranteed. A company could reduce or eliminate its dividends at any time, eroding the yield and potentially the stock price as well. High-yielding companies may also carry more debt, which presents a higher risk.

The correct financial behaviour would be to consider a broader picture of the company's financial health and future prospects. This includes metrics such as earnings growth, price-to-earnings ratios, debt levels, and industry position (Investopedia, n.d.b).
