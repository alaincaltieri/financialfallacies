The fallacy in the statement "You should invest in high-risk, high-reward ventures" stems from the understanding that high risk doesn't inevitably mean high reward. While high-risk investments carry the potential for significant returns, they also carry the potential for significant losses.

Firstly, the risk/reward trade-off principle challenges this fallacy. According to this principle, potential return rises with an increase in risk. However, it's not a guarantee but a potential, which means you could also end up losing all your invested capital (Investopedia, Risk-Return Tradeoff).

In a study by the University of Cambridge, they found that while Chilean pension funds had higher returns when they took more risk, it did not necessarily lead to overall better performance. This study shows that higher risk doesn't always lead to higher returns (Cambridge Judge Business School, For Pension Funds, Risk Does Not Always Equal Reward).

Correct Financial Behaviour: Based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, diversification is commonly accepted as a smart financial behavior. It involves spreading your investments across different asset classes and sectors to reduce risk and potentially increase returns. While diversification cannot guarantee against a loss, it can help reduce the impact of unfavorable market conditions or the poor performance of a single investment.
