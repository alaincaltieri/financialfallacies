The claim that high-fee investment products perform better is a financial fallacy. Empirical evidence suggests that high-fee funds do not necessarily guarantee superior performance. A study from the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK found that "funds which charge high fees do not, on average, perform better than other funds before or after costs". 

Moreover, research by Morningstar has found that low cost funds outperformed high cost funds under almost all circumstances. 

Another problematic aspect of high-fee products is that these fees can significantly eat into your investment returns over time. Small percentage differences in fees can make considerable differences in the total value of an investment portfolio, especially compounded over decades.

The correct financial behavior is to critically evaluate an investment's fees and total return, not simply opting for higher-cost thinking it translates to higher reward.
