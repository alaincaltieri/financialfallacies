This is considered a financial fallacy due to the high levels of risk and volatility associated with trendy cryptocurrencies. These digital currencies can be very unpredictable, with values intensely fluctuating on a daily basis based on various factors, including market speculation and regulatory news or events. This can quickly turn a seemingly profitable investment into a large loss (Chen, 2020).

Also, while some trendy cryptocurrencies may see a boost in their values, others may not, significantly raising the risk of financial losses. For some investors, these risks may outweigh the potential rewards. Some also consider investing in trendy cryptocurrencies as a form of speculation, not true investing.

The correct financial behavior is to have a diversified investment portfolio that includes a mix of low-risk and high-risk investments. This may include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, real estate, as well as a modest proportion of cryptocurrencies. Before investing, thorough research should be done and consultation with finance professionals is recommended. It’s also prudent to understand your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals (Swedroe, 2011).
