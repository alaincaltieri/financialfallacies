This is a common financial fallacy, and here’s why: 

1. Health issues: As we age, our physical and mental health might not allow us to continue working. According to a study by Global Coalition on Aging, 43% of retirees had to retire earlier due to health issues. (Reference: "Retirement in America". Global Coalition on Aging)

2. Unpredictability of Job Market: Depending on the industry, there may not be part-time jobs available. The job market is dynamic and unpredictable. 

3. Inflation rates: Even if a part-time job covers your immediate expenses, it may not keep up with inflation over time. You must consider the purchasing power of your money in the future. (Reference: "Why saving for Retirement is Important". FINRA)

4. Lack of emergency funds: Lack of savings can leave you exposed to financial mishaps or sudden expenses like home repairs or medical bills.

The correct financial behaviour is to start saving early for your retirement. IRAs, 401(k)s, and other retirement plans not only help you grow your savings tax-free, but also ensure a steady income after retirement. Readings like "Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twentieth and Thirties" by Beth Kobliner can give you more insights on how to plan your retirement.

Remember, your retirement plan should be robust enough to handle unexpected turns in life's journey. It should not heavily rely on 'uncertain' factors like your ability to work part-time in the future.
