This statement is a financial fallacy because of the power of compound interest - the ability of your investment to earn interest upon its reinvested earnings over time. The earlier you start saving, the longer your savings have to grow. Not saving early results in a much larger financial burden later as you will have to save more to reach the same goals. 

References:
- "Your Future Self Will Thank You" by Dr. Daniel Crosby highlights the psychological aspects of investing and the importance of investing sooner rather than later. 
- The report “The Power of Compound Interest” by Edward Jones explains the concept of compound interest.

Correct Financial Behavior:
Start saving as soon as you start earning and increase your savings rate over time. A good rule of thumb is to save at least 10-15% of your income. Also, take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts like a 401k or IRA. Diversify your investments to manage risks and aim for long-term capital growth. Lastly, regularly monitor and adjust your financial plan as circumstances change.

- "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing" by John C. Bogle emphasizes on the importance of starting early and sticking to a simple, low-cost, diversified portfolio.
