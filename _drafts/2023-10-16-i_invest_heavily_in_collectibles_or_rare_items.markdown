Investing heavily in collectibles or rare items may be a financial fallacy due to their illiquidity, unpredictability, and lack of intrinsic value. As investments, collectibles are often speculative and not income-generating. Their worth is based on their perceived rarity and desirability, which can change dramatically based on numerous factors. The Minor Asset Class Theory, as demonstrated by Gary Sullivan & Timothy Knapp, show that the return on investment for collectibles is usually lower than traditional investments like bonds or stocks (Sullivan, G. R., & Knapp, T. R. (1999). The minor asset class theory of collectibles. Appraisal Journal).

In addition, it can be challenging to find a buyer when it's time to sell. A special market exists for rare items, and it often requires additional work and time to locate potential buyers (Investopedia).

Instead of heavily investing in collectibles, diversify your portfolio with a mix of investments. According to the Modern Portfolio Theory, diversification reduces risk and increases returns over the long term. You should also make sure the majority of your investments are in assets providing a regular return or dividend (Investopedia).

Appropriate diversification involves spreading your money in different types of investments that offer a return, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds, and ETFs. Diversification helps manage risk and reduce the volatility of an asset's price over time.
