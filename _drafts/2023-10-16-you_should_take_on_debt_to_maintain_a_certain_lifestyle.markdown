This idea is a financial fallacy because it promotes living beyond one's means, which can lead to a cycle of debt that is difficult to break free from. Continually borrowing to finance a certain lifestyle often results in paying more in the long run due to interest and fees, while failing to build personal wealth (Kenton, 2020). It can also lead to financial stress and bankruptcy when one is not able to keep up with repayments.

The correct financial behaviour would be to live within or below one's means, save and invest money, and avoid unnecessary debts. One should create a realistic budget that allows for basic needs, savings, and the occasional splurge rather than continuously incurring debt to finance an unsustainable lifestyle. Prioritise financial security by building an emergency fund, investing for the future, and focusing on long-term financial goals over immediate gratification (Robinson, 2020).
