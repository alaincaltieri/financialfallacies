Investing based on the latest health & wellness trends is considered a financial fallacy because it assumes that the latest trends will continue to rise in value, which isn't always the case. This type of investment strategy lacks diversification, and makes your returns heavily reliant on the performance of one sector. Depending on trends can also cause you to buy high (when the trend is at its peak) and can lead to substantial financial losses if the trend goes down.

The correct financial behaviors include diversifying your investment portfolio, which helps to manage risk, and conducting thorough research before making investment decisions. Long-term investments, rather than chasing short-term trends, is usually the most reliable way to grow your wealth. Also, consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and the amount of time you can commit to managing your investments.
