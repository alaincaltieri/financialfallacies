The belief that you should invest based on recent performance is a financial fallacy due to the concept known as "recency bias." Recency bias is the inclination to weigh recent events more heavily than earlier events. However, in investing, the recent performance does not necessarily predict future performance.

According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, all known information about an investment is already priced into the market and thus, recent performance is not indicative of future returns (Fama, 1970). In other words, just because an investment has performed well recently does not mean it will continue to do so.

Thinking that "This time is different" and extrapolating trends into the future often leads to financial mistakes. As an example, investors who purchased technology stocks at the height of the dot-com bubble because they had been performing well were eventually left with significant losses.

For further concrete understanding, you can refer to "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel. This book emphasizes that short-term changes in stock prices are unpredictable and that investors are better off buying and holding a diversified portfolio.

The correct financial behavior should be based on risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals, rather than past performance. One should also diversify their investments to spread out risk. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing the portfolio to align with the financial goals is another good practice (Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2014). It's essential to remember that investing requires research, analysis, and most importantly, patience.
