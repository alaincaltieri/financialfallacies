Investing all your resources in gold is a financial fallacy because it doesn't generate income or dividends like stocks and real estate. Furthermore, gold's price is highly volatile, subject to economic downturns and inflation. Gold also incurs storage and insurance costs (Investopedia, 2020).

Correct Financial Behaviour: A well-diversified portfolio, balancing between different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, cash, etc.) based on risk tolerance, is the key to long-term financial stability. Regularly rebalancing this portfolio, considering tax consequences and keeping an eye on the costs of investing can help you meet your financial goals (Vanguard,2020)
