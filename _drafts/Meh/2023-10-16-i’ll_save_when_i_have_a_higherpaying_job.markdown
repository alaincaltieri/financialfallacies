Believing that you will start saving when you land a higher paying job is a financial fallacy because it insinuates that you can't save with a lower income, which isn't true. This concept promotes procrastination and excuses not to save. Ideally, saving should begin as soon as you start earning, regardless of your income level. Waiting for a higher-paying job might limit your savings time frame and investment growth (time value of money).

Moreover, higher income often leads to lifestyle upgrades, known as lifestyle inflation, therefore, higher income does not automatically mean increased savings.

Research shows that personal savings should be a regular activity, regardless of how much you earn. However small, the amount put aside regularly can gradually grow into substantial savings that can be invested or used during emergencies.

The Correct Financial Behavior:
It's important to inculcate a saving habit regardless of the income level. Start by creating a budget that includes savings, prioritize putting money aside before any spending occurs. Aim to save a certain percentage of your income, and increase it as your income grows. Understand the concept of "paying yourself first". The key is consistency, discipline, and understanding that every small saving counts.
