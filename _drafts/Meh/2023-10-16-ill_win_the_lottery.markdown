This is a financial fallacy because the chances of winning the lottery are extremely low. For instance, the odds of winning a Powerball jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million while the odds of winning a Mega Millions jackpot are slightly better - 1 in 302.5 million (Ref: CNBC). Relying on this for personal financial success is not a sound strategy.

The correct financial behavior would involve consistent saving, disciplined spending, long-term investing (in diversified portfolios), and regular budget monitoring. Wise decisions about education, career, and home ownership could also contribute to one's financial stability.
