This is a financial fallacy because no job is wholly secure; layoffs, downsizing, or economic downturns can abruptly end employment. Even in stable industries, personal circumstances like illness can prevent one from working. Relying solely on job security for financial stability is a risky strategy (Federal Trade Commission, 2020).  

Further, according to an article from CNBC (2019), 40% of Americans would struggle to come up with $400 for an unexpected expense. Without an emergency fund, these surprise costs can lead to crippling debt. 

The correct financial behaviour is to build an emergency fund. Experts suggest saving between three to six monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses. This provides a buffer in case of sudden job loss, unexpected expenses, or emergencies (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2016).
