This statement is a financial fallacy as advertising alone doesn't determine the financial health or growth potential of a company. A company could be spending heavily on advertising to hide its operational or financial troubles, or to beat tough competition, which doesn't necessarily mean it's a good investment. 

Moreover, a high spending on advertising may not always result in increased revenues or profits. These conclusions require a comprehensive understanding of the industry, along with an in-depth financial analysis of the company (Thompson, 2022).

1. Thompson, Fred (2022) - 'Financial Management Theory and Practice' supports the above reasoning explaining how company financial analysis is a complex task involving more than just observable phenomenons.

Further reading:

Correct financial behaviour relies on thorough research and understanding of company financial statements, including revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and cash flows. An evaluation of the company's strategic plans, leadership, and market positioning is also critical. Market trends and macroeconomic factors should also be considered. It's vital to diversify investments and avoid putting all money in a single company or industry (Bodie, Kane and Marcus, 2014).
