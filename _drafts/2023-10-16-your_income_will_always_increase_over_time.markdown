The statement "Your income will always increase over time" is a financial fallacy because it doesn't take into account certain realities such as economic recessions, industry downturns, job losses, health issues, or salary caps. There's no guarantee that an individual’s income will continually increase throughout their career (Harvard Business Review).

This fallacy can be traced back to the concept of "earnings lifecycle hypothesis" developed by economist Franco Modigliani (Nobel Prize, 1985). However, this concept takes largely into account only the average increase in the society's overall earnings and not an individual’s income (Palgrave Macmillan).

The right financial behaviour would involve planning for income stagnancy or even decrease. It's crucial to build a robust emergency fund, diversify income streams, and invest wisely for the future irrespective of income predictions. Additionally, investing in self-improvement and skills enhancement can help to bolster earning potential.
