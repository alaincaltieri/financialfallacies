The statement "Debt consolidation is always a good idea" is a financial fallacy because while it may result in lower monthly payments, it's not always cost-effective in the long run and doesn't address the behavior that led to debt in the first place.

Debt consolidation loans potentially have higher interest rates and extended pay-off periods, which could lead to paying more over time. Also, these loans may require collateral, putting your assets at risk. It's important to carefully read the loan terms and calculate the total interest costs (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).

Furthermore, debt consolidation only combines multiple debts into one. It doesn't address the root cause. Without a change in spending habits, one might go back into unmanageable debt.

The correct financial behavior would be creating and following a budget, adopting responsible spending habits, and trying to pay off debts starting from that with the highest interest rate. It's also beneficial to consider financial counseling or referring to 'do-it-yourself' debt settlement strategies before considering a consolidation loan (Federal Trade Commission).
