Investing in timeshares or vacation properties often proves to be a financial fallacy due to a number of reasons:

1. Lack of Flexibility: In timeshares, you are usually limited to a specific week or two each year which does not take into account changes in your schedule (Reference: Investopedia).

2. Depreciating Value: Unlike traditional property investments, timeshares seldom appreciate over time and have no resale value. Sellers rarely recoup their initial investments (Reference: CNBC).

3. High Maintenance Fees: Timeshares come with ongoing maintenance fees that increase every year, even if you do not use the property (Reference: AARP).

4. Difficulty in Selling: If you ever decide to sell your timeshare, it's a known fact that the market is more favorably inclined towards buyers (Reference: Forbes).

Correct Financial Behaviour:
It's generally a better strategy to invest in diversified avenues such as index funds, bonds, IRAs, or 401(k)s, which have historical returns, are easier to sell, and/or provide tax advantages. For vacation, instead of a timeshare, it would be better to plan and budget for holidays annually, giving more flexibility and options. 

Always consult with a trusted financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
