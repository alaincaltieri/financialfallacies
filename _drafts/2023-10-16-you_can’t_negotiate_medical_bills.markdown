The belief that you can't negotiate medical bills is a financial fallacy. Medical costs are not always fixed and can, in fact, be negotiated. According to the Consumer Reports, more than half of the patients who negotiated their medical bills were successful. Sometimes, hospitals or doctors may reduce the charges or allow you to schedule a payment plan.

The correct financial behaviour would be to not accept any medical bill blindly. It's crucial to thoroughly review all medical bills, understand what each charge is for, and if something seems incorrect or unreasonably priced, bring it this up to your healthcare provider's billing department. Also, consider seeking assistance from a medical billing advocate if you’re facing particularly high medical bills.
