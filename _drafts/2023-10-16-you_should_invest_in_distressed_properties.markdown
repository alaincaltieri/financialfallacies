The statement that you should invest in distressed properties is a financial fallacy as it heavily oversimplifies a complex investment strategy. 

Investing in distressed properties can be profitable, however, there are significant risks associated with it. These properties usually require substantial renovations or repairs to become inhabitable or attractive to potential buyers or renters, with costs often underestimated. These investments might also face challenges such as legal issues, financial risks, property market fluctuations, and management problems. In addition, distressed properties can be difficult to sell, leaving the investor with an illiquid asset (Investopedia, 2021).

Furthermore, an investment strategy that works for one person may not work for another due to difference in financial resources, knowledge, expertise, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

The correct financial behavior involves thorough research and risk assessment before investing in any property; understanding local markets, potential growth, and the amount of work or cost needed for renovations; diversifying your investments; and seeking professional advice if needed.
