Welcome to Your Financial Fallacies.

I'm Calt, a computer scientist with a passion for debunking financial myths. 

Financial literacy is key to making informed decisions about money. Here, I strive to simplify complex concepts and clarify common misconceptions with practical insights and resources to improve your knowledge. 

## Where to start

There's already a lot of fallacies to unpack on this young project, I understand it can be overwhelming.

You may want to read them all from [the beginning of time]({{ 'only_invest_in_actively_managed_mutual_funds/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} or you can browse them [by category]({{ 'categories/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} based on your interests.

Alternatively, you can follow my journey.

Upon graduation, I believed [money could buy happiness]({{ 'money_can_buy_happiness/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} — maybe not entirely, but a significant portion of it. Working tirelessly, I spent [without saving]({{ 'i_ll_save_when_i_get_a_raise/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, assuming money had purpose only when spent.

The wake-up call came when I struggled to pay rent. Overconfident that I could manage [without a budget]({{ 'i_don_t_need_a_budget/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, I, an [engineer]({{ 'you_need_a_specific_degree_to_be_financially_successful/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, faced financial stress. It dawned on me that [an emergency fund]({{ 'i_can_rely_on_payday_loans_in_emergencies/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} was not just useful but essential. 

My focus on [career advancement]({{ 'i_can_spend_because_i_ll_always_have_a_job/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} hindered financial planning, especially for [retirement]({{ 'i_can_start_saving_for_retirement_later/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, leading to procrastination.

In my 30s, I embraced adulthood. I started a [business from scratch]({{ 'investing_in_a_business_is_a_leap_of_faith/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, began [investing with modest funds]({{ 'you_need_a_lot_of_money_to_start_investing/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, and diligently [saved for retirement]({{ 'i_cant_start_saving_for_retirement_since_im_too_old/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}. Trimming [unnecessary luxuries]({{ 'i_cant_save_by_cutting_out_small_luxuries/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, I [married]({{ 'i_can_spend_because_i_ll_marry_someone_rich/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, purchased a [house]({{ 'pay_off_your_mortgage_early/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, and welcomed [children]({{ 'you_can_t_save_money_if_you_have_children/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, unraveling fallacies one by one. Now I'm targeting some form of lean and safe [Financial Independence]({{ 'follow_the_4_rule_for_retirement_and_chill/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} to keep working only on what is important to me.

I make mistakes, that's where knowledge stems from—alongside insights from [good books]({{ '/pages/resources/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, not so much from YouTube [financial gurus]({{ 'you_should_follow_the_advice_of_financial_gurus/' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

In essence, my financial journey required multiple life changes.

Through this website, I aim to make your path smoother and more comfortable.
