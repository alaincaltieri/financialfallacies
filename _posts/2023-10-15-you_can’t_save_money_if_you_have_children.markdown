This statement is a financial fallacy because while having children can indeed increase expenses, it does not necessarily eradicate the ability to save money. The idea that you can't save money if you have children stems from the perception of increased costs related to raising a child, like healthcare, education, food, and childcare. However, this mindset lacks the consideration of financial planning and budgeting (Gladieux, 2020).

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (2017) estimated that raising a child in the U.S. (excluding college costs) would cost approximately $233,610, but these costs can be managed with proper financial behavior. Factors such as single vs. dual-income households, geographic location, lifestyle choices, and efficient management of income can impact the overall expenses.

Financial literature shows that saving is possible with children by maintaining a budget, automating savings, leveraging tax-advantaged savings accounts for children's future expenses, like 529 plans for education (FINRA, 2020), and considering cost-reducing strategies such as buying in bulk, choosing used items, or sharing costs with other families (Ramsey, 2020). 

Therefore, the correct financial behavior lies in disciplined saving, income management, and smart spending habits, irrespective of life circumstances such as having children.
