This is a financial fallacy because a degree is not the sole determinant of income or wealth. While some degrees can lead to high-paying fields, financial success is also highly dependent on elements like financial literacy, investment strategies, entrepreneurship, and saving behaviors. Furthermore, there are numerous successful figures without any formal degree. The correlation between educational attainment and earnings is not always direct.

Correct Financial Behaviour:
Financial success is not about earning a high income, but about managing money wisely. This includes effectively budgeting, investing, reducing unnecessary expenses, and saving regularly. Practical financial education, financial literacy, and making informed financial decisions are fundamental aspects to financial success. It's also crucial to diversify income sources and to adopt a long term perspective on wealth accumulation and retirement planning.
