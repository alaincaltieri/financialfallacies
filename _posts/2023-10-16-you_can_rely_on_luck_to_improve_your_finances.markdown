Relying on luck, such as lottery winnings or sudden windfalls, to improve finances is a financial fallacy mainly because it promotes a passive, irregular, and a high-risk approach to money management. This is known as the "Luck Strategy" fallacy (Frumkin, 2010). 

This financial fallacy deviates from the widely accepted principles and practices of personal finance management such as regular savings, wise and informed investment, prudent spending, and contingency planning (Weagley et al., 2007). It's essential to view these lottery winnings as a bonus rather than a strategic financial plan. 

A study analysing lottery winners over time found that, for many, winning the lottery led to bankruptcy due to bad financial decisions (Hankins, Hoekstra & Skiba, 2011).

Instead, the correct financial behavioural approach would be to regularly save, invest wisely, spend prudently, diversify your income streams, and to have a contingency plan. This will give a more reliable and predictable financial improvement, providing you with financial independence in the long run.
