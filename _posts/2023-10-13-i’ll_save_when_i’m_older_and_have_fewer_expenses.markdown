The belief 'I'll save when I'm older and have fewer expenses' is a financial fallacy due to several reasons:

1. Time Value of Money - Money's worth decreases over time due to inflation. So, the earlier we save, the higher the value of our savings.

2. Power of Compound Interest - If we start saving early, we can take advantage of compound interest. The longer the time, the greater the amount our savings will accumulate.

3. Uncertain Future Expenses - We cannot be sure that our expenses will decrease as we get older. In fact, health-related and other unforeseen costs are likely to increase as we age.

4. Lesser Income: As we get older, our capacity to earn reduces and we might not be able to save as much as we can during our working years.

Correct Financial Behaviour:
Instead of waiting until you're older to save, start as soon as possible, even if it's a small amount. This is called 'paying yourself first', a basic rule of personal finance. Also, having a budget and a sound financial plan will help you manage your income, expenses and savings effectively.
