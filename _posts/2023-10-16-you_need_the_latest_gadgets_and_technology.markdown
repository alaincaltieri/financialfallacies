This is a financial fallacy because, fundamentally, the latest gadgets and technologies are often not essential for daily life or productivity. They are usually wants, not needs, and often come with a high price tag that can lead to unnecessary financial burdens.

Research shows that electronic devices and digital services make up a significant part of our spending. However, most of these new technologies offer only incremental advances over their predecessors, and their previous versions often serve their purposes equally well at a lower cost (Hogan, V., 2018. "Technology Spending Trends worldwide," Statista).

Moreover, this constant upgrading behaviour can lead to an unsustainable cycle of consumerism, resulting in a financial strain and contributing to environmental problems due to electronic waste (Nowak, P., 2019. "The environmental Costs of a new iPhone," Toronto Star).

A more financially sound behaviour is to only upgrade when necessary. Before making a purchase, carefully consider whether it is an essential need or a want. This involves distinguishing between the things you merely desire and the things you actually need for your work or quality of life (Kyrios, M., 2004. "The Psychology of Consumer Behaviour," Handbook of Contemporary Behavioral Economics).

Furthermore, if an upgrade is needed, consider buying second-hand devices or using trade-in programs to offset the cost. Regular maintenance and care of your existing devices can also prolong their usability and ultimately save money in the long run.
