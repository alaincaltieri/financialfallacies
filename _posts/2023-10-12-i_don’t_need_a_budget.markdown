The belief "I don't need a budget" is a financial fallacy primarily because it dismisses the importance of intentional money management. Without a budget, it's challenging to know exactly where your money is going, let alone to plan for future expenses or set necessary financial goals (Bera, 2019).

A budget gives you control over your finances, promotes discipline, and helps in tracking and cutting unnecessary spending. It also aids in building an emergency fund, saving for retirement, and becoming debt-free (Ramsey Solutions, 2020).

The correct financial behavior should include Detailed budget planning. This would mean allocating specific amounts of money to different needs and wants, alongside saving for emergency funds, and investing for both short-term and long-term goals.
