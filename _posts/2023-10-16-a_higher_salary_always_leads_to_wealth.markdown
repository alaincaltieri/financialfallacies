Financial Fallacy Explanation:

The belief that a higher salary equates to wealth is a financial fallacy because wealth isn't just about how much you earn, but how much you save and invest. It's possible to have a high income but still live paycheck to paycheck if you continually increase your living expenses (a phenomenon known as lifestyle inflation) or fail to manage your money effectively.

References and Further Readings:

1. "Your Money or Your Life" by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin - This book emphasizes the importance of saving, investing, and mindful spending.
2. "The Millionaire Next Door" by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko - In this book, you'll learn the habits of truly wealthy individuals, including the tendency to live below their means regardless of income.

Correct Financial Behaviour:

The most robust financial behavior involves regularly saving a portion of your salary, regardless of how much you make. This saved money should then be invested wisely to generate additional passive income. Keeping spending in check and avoiding unnecessary debt is also critical. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your financial plan, tracking your expenses, and having an emergency fund are also important tenets of sound financial behavior.   

Books such as "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki and "The Total Money Makeover" by Dave Ramsey further delve into these topics.
