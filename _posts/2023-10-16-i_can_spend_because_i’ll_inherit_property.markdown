This is a financial fallacy due to several reasons. First, there's no guarantee when or even if you will inherit property. Life's unpredictability can change circumstances and intentions (source: Investopedia). Secondly, even if you do inherit property, it might come with hidden costs such as taxes, maintenance, and legal fees, which can diminish its value (source: Kiplinger).

Counting on an inheritance to cover for current overspending is a risky strategy and not smart financial planning. It encourages living beyond one's means, and without the guarantee of an inheritance, can easily lead to debt (source: NerdWallet).

Correct financial behavior is to live within one's current means. This involves managing expenses according to current income, saving for the future, and investing wisely. Property inheritance, if it occurs, should be considered a bonus, not relied upon to solve overspending habits (source: The Balance).

Remember, it's crucial to formulate sound budgets and savings plans based on your current financial status, not future hypothetical scenarios.
