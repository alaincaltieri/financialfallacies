The idea of "timing the market" (buying low and selling high) may seem like a sound strategy in theory but it's considered a fallacy due to its practical difficulty and risks. Market timing implies that an investor can predict market movements accurately, which can be extremely tricky due to the unpredictable nature of the financial markets and the myriad of factors that influence them (investment performance, geopolitical events, economic data, etc.).

Most financial advisors typically advise against market timing. A report from Vanguard ("The Pros and Cons of Market Timing") suggests that it's nearly impossible to be consistently successful at market timing. A study by Dalbar ("Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior, 2020") found that average investors heavily underperform the market primarily due to attempts to time the market.

The recommended financial behaviour is to hold a diversified portfolio and stick to a predetermined, long-term investment strategy. This approach, known as "buy and hold", involves buying a broad selection of stocks, bonds, or other investments and holding onto them for a long period of time, regardless of market fluctuations.
