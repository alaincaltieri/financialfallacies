Claiming that your child's entire education can be paid with scholarships is a financial fallacy because it assumes certainty in a very uncertain process. Scholarships are not guaranteed; they are competitive and based on various criteria including academic achievement, athletic abilities, or other unique attributes. Additionally, not all scholarships cover full tuition costs, some offer just a few hundred dollars (Paying for College, Federal Student Aid).

Besides, relying solely on scholarships can cause financial stress and possibly force students into debt if they do not receive as many scholarships as anticipated. It places the responsibility of financing education entirely onto the student, which could detract from their academic focus.

The responsible financial behaviour is to start saving for your child’s education as early as possible. You can consider education savings accounts like 529 plans in the US. Diversifying your opportunities for funding, through a combination of savings, scholarships, and potential loans, can help spread risk and ensure a more stable financial future for your child's education.
