Investing in the latest fad or trend can relate to the "Greater Fool Theory", suggesting that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether overvalued or not, and later selling them at a profit because there will always be someone (i.e., a "greater fool") who is willing to pay the higher price. This is inherently risky, as it relies heavily on market sentiment and timing, rather than a sound evaluation of the underlying financials of the investment. (Reference: Investopedia, Greater Fool Theory)

Indeed, research has shown that chasing trends often lead to poor investment returns. Dalbar's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behaviour (QAIB) annually reveals investor returns that lag the S&P 500 partly due to investors' attempt to time the market by hopping into the hot trend (Reference: Dalbar, QAIB).

A more prudent approach involves the principles of diversification, risk management and long-term investing. Diversification is a method of managing risk by investing in a variety of assets to avoid the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket (Reference: Investopedia, Diversification). Meanwhile, the concept of 'buy and hold', emphasizes long-term investing, often in well-established companies or index funds which tend to perform well over time, despite market fluctuations (Reference: Fidelity, Buy and Hold Strategy). 

Lastly, financial planning helps to align individual's financial decisions with their life goals and investing in accordance with their risk tolerance and time horizon. All these principles are fundamental to successful investing (Reference: Journal of Financial Planning, Foundations of Successful Investing).
