The financial fallacy: "You can get rich through day trading" is based on the misconception that day trading is a quick and easy way to amass wealth. In reality, successful day trading requires immense knowledge about the financial markets, a well-developed trading strategy, emotional control, and luck. Many studies reveal that the majority of day traders lose money, making it a high-risk investment strategy. Some factors contributing to this include transaction costs, capital gains taxes, and the psychological stress of the rapid decision-making process. 

Correct Financial behaviour:

The correct financial behaviour entails understanding that investing involves discipline, patience, and diversification. Instead of trying to make quick gains through high-risk strategies like day trading, wealth accumulation generally comes from carefully building a diverse portfolio of investments that grow over time. This includes buying and holding assets such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
