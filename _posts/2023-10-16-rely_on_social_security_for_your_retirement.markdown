Relying solely on Social Security for retirement is a financial fallacy due to the following reasons:

1. Insufficient income: Social Security benefits are meant to replace only about 40% of pre-retirement income, which may not be enough for most retirees to maintain their current living standard (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2021).

2. Uncertain future of program: The trust funds that Social Security relies on for operations are predicted to be exhausted by the 2030s, and without corrective measures, the program may only be capable of paying out about 75% of scheduled benefits (Social Security Administration, 2021).

The correct financial behaviour involves saving and investing for retirement on your own. This could be through employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and other investment vehicles. You should also consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized retirement savings plan.

Remember, one major key to a financially secure retirement is proactive planning and saving. Always have a diversified portfolio and not depend on a single income stream.
