This statement may seem like a financial fallacy because risk tolerance depends on many factors, including your age, income stability, financial goals, family obligations, and assets and debts. Claiming to handle high-risk investments can lead to potential losses if you don't consider these factors carefully. It also forgets the essential rule of diversification in investment portfolios to spread the risk (Pereira & Zhang, 2010).

The correct financial behavior would be to properly assess one's risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment horizon before deciding on the appropriate asset allocation. Diversifying your investments to ensure you have a mix of high, medium, and low-risk assets can also ensure a balanced portfolio to mitigate risks effectively. Always seek professional financial advice to create the right investment strategy.
