Believing that you need the latest fashion and luxury items is a financial fallacy for several reasons. Foremost, it feeds into the concept of 'hedonic adaptation,' where a person's level of happiness temporarily increases with a new purchase, but quickly returns to a baseline level as he or she acclimates to the new item. This triggers a cycle of continuous spending in pursuit of happiness, forming a destructive habit. 

Second, it builds upon the misleading notion that self-worth is tied to material possessions, commonly known as 'materialism.' It can lead to unnecessary financial stress and debt as people try to keep up with growing and changing trends. 

Third, it doesn't account for the crucial concept of 'opportunity cost,' meaning the lost potential gain from other options when one alternative is chosen. In simple words, the money we spend on these items could have been used for investments, savings, or other purchases that can add long-term value.

People might fall for this fallacy due to societal pressures, advertising campaigns and a natural desire to fit in and feel admired. There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to feel good about oneself, and for some, designer leathers or fancy cars provide that. However, problems arise when we allow these desires to dictate our spending patterns, especially when it leads to credit card debt, loans, or insufficient savings for emergencies, retirement and other life goals.

The correct financial behavior would be one more focused on long-term financial health and happiness instead of short-term pleasures. This involves creating a budget, making wise investments, setting financial goals, and realizing that material possessions do not lead to lasting happiness nor determine your self-worth.
