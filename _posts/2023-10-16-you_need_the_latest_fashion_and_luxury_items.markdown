This belief is a financial fallacy because it confuses wants with needs. The desire for the latest fashion and luxury items is driven by external pressures such as social status or popularity, not a genuine need. These items tend to be more expensive and do not necessarily provide any added functional value over less prestigious alternatives. Further, such spending can result in unnecessary debt and prevent financial success.

The correct financial behaviour includes distinguishing between wants and needs, living within your means, and prioritizing long-term financial goals. It's essential to save and invest money rather than spend it on status symbols. Lifestyle choices should align with personal values and financial objectives, instead of keeping up with the latest trends. It's beneficial to create a budget to track spending and ensure you're living within your means.
