The statement "Investing in a business is a leap of faith" can be deemed a fallacy because modern investment practice is grounded on detailed financial analysis, not mere faith. This involves careful assessment of business plans, markets, management teams, and other pertinent factors that influence a company's potential success.

Instead, the correct financial behaviour is to conduct in-depth due diligence before making an investment decision. This may include a business's financial strength (balance sheet analysis), profitability (income statement analysis), cash flow (cash flow statement analysis), and other qualitative factors such as competitive advantage, management, industry position etc. Smart investing is not a bet or a gamble; it's a decision made based on careful scrutiny and reasoned analysis.
