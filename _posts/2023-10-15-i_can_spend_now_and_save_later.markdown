The statement "I can spend now and save later" is a financial fallacy because it assumes that future income is guaranteed and that expenditure patterns will remain the same. However, life is unpredictable. You may encounter unforeseen circumstances such as job loss, economic downturn, or unexpected expenses like medical bills. Additionally, if you develop a habit of spending beyond your means, it can be hard to transition into a saving mindset later.

Moreover, it neglects the concept of compound interest, one of the most powerful principles of investing. The earlier you start saving, the more time your money has to grow. For instance, if you start saving in your 20s, the money has 40 years to grow before retirement, but if you start in your 40s, it only has 20 years.

The correct financial behavior is to save and invest consistently from an early age, live within your means, and have a plan for regular increases in the amount saved or invested. It's important to make a budget and stick to it, prioritize needs over wants, establish an emergency fund, and work towards long-term financial goals like retirement.
