This fallacy can be seen from a few perspectives: 

1. Financial Unpredictability: The future is generally uncertain. Your children might face their own financial challenges and may not be able to support you as hoped during your retirement years. 

2. Independence Risk: Relying on your children for financial support means giving up a portion of your financial independence. This could potentially put a strain on your relationships with them.

3. Financial Pressure: It places unnecessary financial pressure on your children. 

The correct financial behavior implies adopting a sensible, proactive approach towards retirement savings. This includes creating an investment plan and regularly saving money for your retirement, relying on your own savings and investments, and maintaining an emergency fund.
