First of all, claiming that "you can't be financially successful without a college degree" is a financial fallacy because it assumes that financial success is strictly tied to one's educational attainment, specifically with a college degree. However, that's not necessarily the case. Many highly successful individuals, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Richard Branson, dropped out of college yet have achieved immense financial success. This doesn't mean that education isn't important; it just shows that different paths could lead to financial success.

True financial success comes from a combination of factors such as financial literacy, disciplined saving and investing, smart decision-making, consistent income generation, diversifying income sources, and responsible spending habits. It's not dependent on a single factor like a college degree.

The correct financial behaviour involves managing your money wisely. This includes making a budget and sticking to it, saving a portion of your income, investing sensibly, and minimizing debt. It also involves continuously educating yourself about personal finance, whether or not you have a formal education.
