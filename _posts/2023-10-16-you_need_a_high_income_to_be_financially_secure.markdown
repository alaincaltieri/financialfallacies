This statement is a financial fallacy because financial security is not solely determined by high income, but more dependent on habits such as budgeting, saving, effective debt management, and investing wisely. Someone with a high income can still be financially unstable if they spend recklessly, have high debt, and lack savings or investments.

A classic reference is Thomas Stanley's "The Millionaire Next Door," which noted that most wealthy individuals aren't necessarily high income earners but are adept at managing their finances. Similarly, in her book "Broke Millennial," Erin Lowry emphasizes the importance of smart money habits over large incomes.

The correct financial behavior involves living within your means, saving regularly (aim for 20% of income as stated in Elizabeth Warren's 50/30/20 rule), reducing and managing debt efficiently, and making informed investment decisions for long-term financial growth. Also, continually expanding financial literacy through books, online courses, and financial advisory services matters because knowing how to manage money is vital regardless of income level.
