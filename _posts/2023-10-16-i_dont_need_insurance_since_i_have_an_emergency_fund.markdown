This belief is financially unsound because an emergency fund, while it provides a basic level of financial security, might not cover all the expensive emergencies that insurance typically covers. There are several events, such as a serious illness, extensive home damage, significant liability claims, or loss of life, which could overwhelm your emergency fund.

Insurance is designed to transfer significant potential financial risk to an insurer for a relatively small cost (premium), essentially spreading the risk over several policyholders. It's a vital tool in financial planning because it offers protection against unexpected significant loss, therefore providing you with peace of mind.

Certainly, you might not need insurance for manageable risks, which are small losses you can comfortably pay out of pocket. Nonetheless, having insurance is essential for catastrophic risks, which are significant losses that could financially ruin you.

For a comprehensive understanding refer to these resources:

1. "The Importance of Insurance in Financial Planning" by Preeti Sharma: https://www.financegab.com/insurance/importance-of-insurance-in-financial-planning/
2. "How Much Insurance Do You Need?" by Michael Lewis: https://www.moneycrashers.com/insurance-coverage-need/

The correct financial behaviour would be to:

1. Establish an emergency fund to cover small and predictable losses.
2. Buy appropriate insurance policies to cover potential catastrophic losses.
3. Regularly review insurance needs and premium costs to ensure that they still fit within your financial plan and budget. 

This measured approach will provide you with a solid financial foundation to handle both predictable and unpredictable financial challenges.
