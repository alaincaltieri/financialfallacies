While there may be a sense of patriotism in investing solely in your own country's economy, this approach is a financial fallacy due to lack of diversification, which can be very risky. Concentrating investments in a single country exposes investors to higher potential losses if that country's economy suffers. 

Diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique contends that a portfolio of different kinds of investments will, overall, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio. (Investopedia: Diversification (investopedia.com)) 

For example, comparing the historical returns of foreign and U.S. stocks from 1970 to 2019, while U.S. stocks have outperformed foreign stocks over the last decade, there have been extended periods of time when foreign stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks. This evidence suggests diversifying investments outside of an investor's home country may be beneficial. (Vanguard: Considerations for investing in non-U.S. equities (vanguard.com)) 

Correct financial behavior advocates for a well-diversified investment portfolio that includes exposure to international markets. Depending on an individual investor's situation and tolerance for risk, this could mean having a percentage of their portfolio invested in foreign equities.
