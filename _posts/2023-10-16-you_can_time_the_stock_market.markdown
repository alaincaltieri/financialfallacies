Timing the stock market is a common financial fallacy because it is nearly impossible to predict exactly when to buy low and sell high. The market's performance is influenced by a multitude of factors such as economic indicators, political environment, global events, and investor sentiment, most of which are outside an individual investor's control. 

Further, studies have shown that most people who try to time the market tend to underperform compared to those who maintain a long-term oriented, buy-and-hold strategy. This is demonstrated in a study by Dalbar Inc. (2016) which finds that average investors often hurt their performance by trying to time the market.

The correct financial behaviour involves developing a balanced, diversified investment portfolio based on risk tolerance, financial goals and time horizon, regularly rebalancing the portfolio, and maintaining the discipline to stick to one's investment plan even during market volatility. It's about time in the market, not timing the market.
