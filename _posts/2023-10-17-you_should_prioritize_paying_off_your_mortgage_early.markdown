Paying off your mortgage early may seem like a wise decision because it can lead to a sense of financial freedom. However, this approach is considered a financial fallacy due to a number of reasons. First, mortgages usually come with relatively low interest rates compared to other types of debt. This means you could potentially get a higher return by investing the money wisely instead of rushing to pay off your mortgage.

Second, maintaining your mortgage can provide a tax benefit as mortgage interest is tax-deductible.

Lastly, paying off a mortgage early reduces liquidity which can be crucial during an emergency or an unforeseen expense.

Consequently, the advised financial behavior is to prioritize building a diverse and well-balanced financial portfolio through a combination of saving, investing, and the responsible paying down of debts. It's a recommended strategy because it considers long-term growth, financial risk reduction, and retirement funding. However, individual financial situations will vary, so it's recommended to consult with a qualified financial advisor.
