Believing that you can rely on luck to improve your finances is a financial fallacy due to its inherent unpredictability and lack of control. Building a stable financial future requires consistent effort, determination, and sound financial strategies. Luck, by definition, is an unpredictable force that is beyond our control. Hence, solely relying upon luck equates to placing your financial future in the hands of chance, rather than in your own. This method is unsustainable and often leads to financial instability.

Correct financial behaviour involves diligent planning, systematic investments, prudent spending, and regular saving. It's about understanding your cash flow, setting achievable financial goals, budgeting wisely, managing debts, and regularly reviewing your investment portfolio. It's recommended to seek professional advice when needed and continue educating oneself about financial management best practices.
