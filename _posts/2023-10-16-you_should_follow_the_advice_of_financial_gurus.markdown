The financial fallacy lies in the fact that no 'one-size-fits-all' financial advice exists. Advice from financial gurus may be sound, but it may not be entirely suitable for everyone due to individual financial situations, goals, risk tolerance, income, etc. This misconception can lead to unplanned financial decisions, potentially inviting risks (1).

The correct financial behaviour is to make decisions based on personal circumstances, long and short term goals, and risk tolerance. It involves understanding your unique financial needs, getting professional advice that understands your context, and continuously educating oneself about personal finance (2). Furthermore, diversifying investments, having an emergency fund, insuring against large financial risks, planning and saving for retirement are also advisable actions.
