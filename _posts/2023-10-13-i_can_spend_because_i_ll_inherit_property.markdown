Believing "I can spend because I'll inherit property" is a financial fallacy for several reasons. 

Firstly, property inheritance is not guaranteed. There can be legal disputes, debts to be settled, or the value of the property may decrease over time. If the property has to be sold to pay someone else's creditors, the inheritance might disappear. 

Secondly, living beyond your means in expectation of future windfalls can lead to significant financial problems such as debt, bad credit ratings, or even bankruptcy. This does not even take into consideration the sudden unexpected costs such as medical emergencies or car repairs which can put you further into debt. 

Correct financial behavior is living within your means: don't spend money you don't have and never count on money that isn't in your account. Additionally, building and maintaining an emergency fund, consistent savings and wise investments are paramount to financial health.
