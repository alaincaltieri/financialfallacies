The financial fallacy "buy in bulk to save money" assumes that buying large quantities of goods or services at once always results in cost savings. However, this isn't always the case. Firstly, the initial outlay can be expensive, even if the cost per item is lower. For those on a tight budget, this can result in financial strain. Secondly, buying in bulk can lead to unnecessary waste if the items aren't consumed before their expiry, can't be stored appropriately, or if the buyer's needs change. Thirdly, there can also be additional costs such as storage fees, if the items can't be stored at home. 

Correct financial behaviour would be to calculate the cost per unit of products, determine if you have sufficient storage space, and ascertain whether the item will be used before its expiration date. Taking these precautions can help ensure the bulk purchase is truly economical.
