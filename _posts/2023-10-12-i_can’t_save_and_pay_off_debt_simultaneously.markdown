The belief that one cannot save and pay off debt simultaneously is indeed a fallacy. It's not always necessary or advisable to dedicate every spare dollar to debt repayment. Financial advisers even warn against it because it can leave you unprepared for emergencies. If you focus exclusively on debt repayment and neglect your savings, you could end up adding to your debt if unexpected expenses arise.

A 2019 article by CNBC recommends saving while paying off debt to prevent falling back into debt [1]. Similarly, personal finance expert Dave Ramsey suggests establishing a basic emergency fund before beginning serious debt repayment [2].

The correct financial behavior is to strike a balance between saving and debt repayment. Building an emergency fund should come first, but once that cushion is created, you could devote extra funds toward debt. Another strategy is to allocate a certain percentage of your income toward savings and another towards debt, thus ensuring both areas get attention [3].
