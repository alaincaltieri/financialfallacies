The financial fallacy of "I'll save when I get a raise" is based on the premise that increased income will inevitably lead to increased savings. However, this idea neglects a common phenomenon known as lifestyle creep or lifestyle inflation, where as a person's income increases so do their expenditures. This fallacy assumes that with an increase in earnings, there will be a surplus that can be saved. However, if one's expenses rise at the same rate as their income or even at a higher rate, it leaves no extra money for saving. 

The correct financial behavior would involve prioritizing saving and investing, regardless of income level. It's advised to start saving as early and as consistently as possible while maintaining a reasonable lifestyle that does not increase significantly with income. Additionally, each time you receive a raise, it is smart to increase the amount you save or invest accordingly, so the proportion of your savings grows with your income. This behavior is often referred to as 'paying yourself first' and promotes good savings habits.
