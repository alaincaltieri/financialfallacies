The argument "I can spend because I’ll always have a job" is a financial fallacy for several reasons. This approach assumes your income is both stable and guaranteed which is rarely the case. Job loss, pay reductions, company restructuring or even economic shifts can disrupt the normal flow of income. This fallacy also fails to take into account expected or unexpected life events such as health issues, family emergencies, and retirement which could necessitate extra financial provisions. Over-spending consistently without saving for emergencies or future events can lead to financial instability, debts and financial distress.

The correct financial behaviour is maintaining a balanced approach towards money management. This primarily includes living within or below one's means, regular saving and investing, having an emergency fund, contemplating over insurance covers and planning more thoroughly for the future, like retirement. It's recommended to have a disciplined budgeting process, a clear view of one's income and expenditure, and a pattern of smart spending that contributes to long-term financial health and stability.
