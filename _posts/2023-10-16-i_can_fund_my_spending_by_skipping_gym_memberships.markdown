The financial fallacy comes from two erroneous assumptions: 1) skipping gym memberships would free up enough money to support spending, and 2) spending that money instead of investing or saving is a sound financial strategy.

1) While it's true that skipping gym memberships can save money, the amount may not be substantial enough to fund major spending habits, especially long-term ones. This might give a false perception that we can afford other discretionary expenses, which can lead to financial trouble.

2) The other problem is implying that spending money is preferable to saving or investing. This view does not account for the importance of emergency funds, retirement savings, or investment growth over time.

In essence, responsible financial behavior involves budgeting, where one sets allocation for needs, wants, savings, and investments. Even if saving on gym membership is part of the plan, the extra fund should be used to bolster financial security first before discretionary spending.

Correct financial behavior thus emphasizes budgeting, saving before spending, investing, and financial security. It's also essential to avoid assuming that small economic changes, like cutting a gym membership, will drastically enhance one's financial situation.
