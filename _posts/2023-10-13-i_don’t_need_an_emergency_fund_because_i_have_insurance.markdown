This mindset is a financial fallacy because insurance and an emergency fund serve different purposes. Insurance covers specific risks like health issues, automobile accidents, home damage, etc. and typically comes with an 'exclusion list'. An emergency fund, however, covers unexpected personal financial crises, including situations not covered by insurance, like job loss, sudden trips for family emergencies, or immediate home repairs. 

Further, insurance claims involve processes that could delay the immediate availability of funds. Having an emergency fund provides instant access to money without having to wait for claim approval or paying high-interest rates on credit loans.

The correct financial behavior is to maintain both an insurance policy for your essential assets—like your life, health, car, home—and also an emergency fund to cover immediate, unexpected expenses. Many experts recommend that your emergency fund should contain enough to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses.
