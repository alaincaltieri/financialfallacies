The belief that "renting is throwing money away" is a financial fallacy because it oversimplifies the complex financial dynamics involved in the decision to rent or buy a house.

1. Flexibility: Renting provides more flexibility compared to owning a house. Mobility can be a significant advantage for people in unstable employment or those likely to relocate. 

2. Maintenance Costs and Property Taxes: Homeowners have additional costs that renters do not, including property taxes, maintenance, and HOA fees. These can make owning significantly more expensive than renting. 

3. Market Risk: Homeownership comes with the risk that the property might decrease in value, while the cost of renting is generally stable and predictable.

4. Opportunity Cost: The cash tied up in a house could be invested more profitively elsewhere.

Here are some references for further reading:
- "Is Renting Really a Waste of Money?" (Investopedia, [source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/083115/renting-vs-owning-home-pros-and-cons.asp))
- “Renting vs. Buying a Home: Which is smarter?” (Considerable, [source](https://www.considerable.com/home/real-estate/rent-versus-buy/))
 
The correct financial behavior would be to weigh the costs and benefits of both renting and buying before making a decision. This may involve analyzing factors like the duration of stay, local real estate market, personal financial situation, lifestyle preferences, and job stability. A rent vs. buy calculator (like those from Bankrate or Nerdwallet) could be utilized while making this decision.
  
It's also sensible to consider homeownership as a lifestyle choice more than an investment avenue, as it presumes potential risks and rewards. Remember, diversification is key to a balanced investment portfolio (source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification/)).
