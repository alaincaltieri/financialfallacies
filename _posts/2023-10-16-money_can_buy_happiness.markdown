"Money can buy happiness" is a common fallacy because it assumes that material possessions and wealth directly equate to emotional satisfaction. According to psychologists, happiness is driven by intangible things like good health, strong relationships, and personal fulfillment rather than financial wealth (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010; Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2002).

Furthermore, several studies have found that after a certain income level, more money does not lead to more happiness. Kahneman & Deaton (2010) found that emotional well-being rises with income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. 

Moreover, money can sometimes contribute to unhappiness. Being materialistic or constantly seeking more wealth can lead to anxiety, depression and lower life satisfaction (Kasser, 2002).

The healthiest financial behaviour is to use money as a tool for stability and possibility rather than seeing it as a goal in itself. Having enough money to cover our needs and some of our wants can contribute to happiness, but it's also crucial to invest in relationships, personal growth, and experiences.
