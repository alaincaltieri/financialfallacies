Relying on payday loans in emergencies can be considered a financial fallacy due to the high interest rates and fees associated with them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau states that the average payday loan has an APR of around 400%. This means you could end up paying back significantly more than you borrowed, trapping you in a cycle of debt.

Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission advises that if you need to use payday loans regularly, it's a definite sign that your financial health is in poor condition. It indicates you're not setting aside an emergency fund, or not managing your budget effectively. Payday loans should be a last resort, not a regular solution.

The correct financial behaviour would be setting up an emergency fund. An emergency fund is designed to cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses and can provide a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses. Regularly investing a portion of your income into this fund is a better approach to handling unexpected financial emergencies.

Correct Financial Behaviour:

2. Budget effectively and live within your means
3. Consider alternatives before turning to payday loans. Reach out to credit unions, banks, or even friends and family.
