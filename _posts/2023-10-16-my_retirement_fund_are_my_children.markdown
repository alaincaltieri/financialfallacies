Relying on your children for your retirement fund is considered a financial fallacy for several reasons. 

Firstly, it puts unnecessary pressure on your children to support you financially, while they likely have their own financial responsibilities such as their own families, homes, or student loans. 

Secondly, it is also risky to depend on others for your financial security. If your children were to face financial difficulties of their own, they may not be able to support you as planned.

Thirdly, this also assumes that your children will be willing and able to assist you financially, which may not be the case due to strained relationships, relocation, or differing priorities.

Finally, this could potentially devalue your childrenâ€™s future. By being financially dependent on them in retirement, you might stunt their ability to save, invest, and grow their wealth.

Refer to these articles for more detailed information:
1. "Why Depending On Your Kids In Retirement Is A Bad Strategy" by Forbes.
2. "Should you depend on the kids for retirement Income?" by MarketWatch.

The correct financial behaviour should be to proactively plan and save for your own retirement. Start investing early, take advantage of compounding interest, manage your risk levels as you near retirement age, and subscribe to retirement plans or social security benefits offered in your country. You can also consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Some useful readings are:
1. "Starting to save for retirement" by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
2. "Saving and Investing for Retirement" by Forbes.

Remember that it's essential to build a financially secure future not just for you, but also for your children. Not only will this ease your worries about your financial future, but it will materially help your children as well.
