The financial fallacy here lies in the principle of "keeping up with the Joneses," which refers to the concept of trying to match or surpass your neighbour or peer's wealth or conspicuous consumption. The danger in this belief is that it encourages unnecessary, often impulsive spending without consideration of individual financial situations or future financial goals.

The correct financial behaviour is financial independence, living within one's means, and aligning spending with personal values and goals. This requires creating a budget and following it, setting financial goals, saving and investing for future needs or emergencies, and spending on what brings genuine value and happiness, disregarding external pressures.
