While it's true excessive debt can be detrimental, not all debt is inherently harmful. Rather, it all comes down to the type of debt – good debt and bad debt.

Good debt is seen as an investment that will grow in value, such as student loans, mortgages, and business loans. These are perceived to contribute to one's overall financial growth and can build credit when managed properly (NerdWallet, 2020). 

Bad debt, however, is associated with depreciating assets or unnecessary consumer goods, such as credit cards and personal loans used for non-essential items or services. Interest rates on these types of debt can make repayment difficult (Bankrate, 2021). 

Learning to manage debt strategically can be beneficial. This involves keeping a close eye on one's credit score, limiting unnecessary expenses, creating a realistic budget, and prioritizing paying off high-interest debts.
