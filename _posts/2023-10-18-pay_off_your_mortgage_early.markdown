Paying off your mortgage early is often seen as a financial fallacy for several reasons. Firstly, mortgages are usually the cheapest debt a person can have, with interest rates often significantly lower than other forms of debt such as credit cards or car loans. By focusing on paying off your mortgage before these higher-interest debts, you may end up spending more in interest overall.

Secondly, investing extra money instead of paying off your mortgage can often yield a higher return over the long run. Many investment avenues available, such as stocks or mutual funds, tend to yield higher returns compared with the interest saved by paying off a mortgage early.

Lastly, the tax benefits associated with mortgage interest can be beneficial. In certain tax brackets, the amount paid in interest can be deducted, reducing your overall taxable income.

The correct financial behaviour in this context would be to prioritize paying off high-interest debts first, then build an emergency fund. Once these are in place, focusing on investing your surplus cash for the long-term should be considered. This should be balanced with paying down your mortgage at a reasonable rate.
