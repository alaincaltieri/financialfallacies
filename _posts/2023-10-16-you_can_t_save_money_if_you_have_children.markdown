The statement "You can't save money if you have children" is a financial fallacy because it implies that having children inevitably leads to financial stress or impossibility to save, which is not universally true. The ability to save money is contingent largely on personal financial management, budgeting skills, and prioritization. While it is undeniable that raising children involves significant expenses, these costs can be planned for and managed effectively without sacrificing the ability to save. It is essential to factor in these expenses into your overall budget, just like you'd do with any other major recurring expense.

The correct financial behaviour when you have children or are planning to have them involves practicing disciplined and strategic financial planning. This includes setting a budget, consistently following it, and allocating your resources thoughtfully. It means reducing unnecessary expenses, instilling the value of money in your children from an early age, and seeking out economical alternatives for expensive necessities. It's also important to start saving for their future, such as college expenses, right from the start.
