The belief that you can't negotiate your salary is indeed a fallacy. In fact, many employers actually expect salary negotiations and may start with a lower offer in anticipation of this. Studies have found that those who chose to negotiate increased their salary by more than 7% (Babcock, 2007). 

Although some jobs do have a set salary, the majority of positions have some degree of flexibility. Not negotiating can result in lower lifetime earnings. A study by Linda Babcock showed that, over a lifetime, failing to negotiate on an initial salary offer could leave an employee earning up to $500,000 less by the time they retire (Babcock, Linda. 2003).

The correct financial behaviour would be to do research on the typical pay rates for your position in your industry and area, make sure you understand your value in the job market and be prepared to sell your skills and experiences to your potential employer. 

You can also prepare counterarguments for potential salary objections and practice your negotiation skills. Just remember, the negotiation is not just about salary but also about other benefits like vacation time, flexible hours, bonuses, etc.
