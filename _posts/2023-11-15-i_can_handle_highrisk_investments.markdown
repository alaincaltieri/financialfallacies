The assertion "I can handle high-risk investments" is a financial fallacy primarily because it assumes that one's ability to handle the emotional stress and pressure associated with these investments equates to real, quantifiable success. Markets are unpredictable and even professionals with decades of experience can face massive losses on high-risk investments. Overconfidence can add more risk to your financial profile and might not have the returns to justify that extra risk. 

The correct financial behavior is balanced and diversified investing. It involves a mixture of safe and risky investments in proportions that match an individual's risk tolerance, financial capacity, and investment goals. It includes evaluating each investment not only on its individual merits but also on its contribution to the overall risk of the portfolio. The right behavior also involves continuous education, regular market reviews and adapting your strategy as markets or personal circumstances change.
