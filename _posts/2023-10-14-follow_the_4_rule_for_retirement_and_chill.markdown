The 4% retirement rule is a common financial advice guideline that defines a strategy for using your savings in retirement and dictates how much you needed to accumulate in order to avoid depleting your capital too soon. The fallacy here is that this rule ignores several important factors.

1. Market volatility: This rule does not account for potential market downturns which could significantly reduce your retirement savings and that may have a psychological tool on the investor.

2. Personal spending: The rule assumes that your spending will remain stable throughout retirement. But this may not be the case due to healthcare costs or other needs.

3. Longevity: Everyone's lifespan is unique. Following the 4% rule might leave some who live longer with the risk of outliving their savings. The rule was tested considering a 30 year timespan.

4. Failure rates: The 4% rule does not guarantee thet you'll not deplete your capital, it only states that it will be unlikely. Still there have been past scenarios in which depletion happened or was really close.

5. Economic boom: the 4% rule was calculated for US investors, during a timespan of economic boom and world domination that may not repeat in the future or for other nations.

The correct financial behaviour for retirement planning should include:

1. Adjustment according to personal needs: Tailor your withdrawal rate and spending based on your personal needs and lifestyle.

2. Adjustment according to market fluctuation: spend less when markets are low, spend more when they are high.

3. Explore alternative and more effective strategies for withdrawing your capital during retirement.
