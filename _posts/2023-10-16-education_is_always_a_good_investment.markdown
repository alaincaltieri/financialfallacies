The belief that education is always a good investment is a financial fallacy because the returns on this investment aren't guaranteed. The success of an educational investment greatly depends on factors such as the choice of field, the quality of the institution, the cost of education, and the individual's utilization of the acquired knowledge and skills. 

Many students enter college without a clear career path, which may lead them to pursue degrees that have lower returns on investment (ABC News, 2019). Also, the rise in tuition costs may lead to excessive student loan debt, making the financial burden outweigh the benefits of the education (Brookings, 2019).

The correct financial behaviour involves a thorough analysis of the cost and potential return on investment before pursuing an education. Students should consider the demand for professionals in their desired field, average income, and the cost of education, including any potential student loans.

Remember, education is an important facet of personal growth and societal development, but it must also be viewed pragmatically as an investment with potential financial returns.
