"I only buy the most popular stocks": Most popular stocks often refer to the stocks of renowned or high visibility companies that constantly get covered in the news. Investing solely based on popularity is a fallacy since popular stocks aren't necessarily the best or the most profitable ones. High popularity often leads to overvaluation of stocks, causing investors to buy at a high price. Many of these stocks might not provide the best returns relative to their risk level. Moreover, investing only in popular stocks means you are not diversifying your portfolio, which is a cardinal investment principle to limit losses. 

The Correct financial behavior in equity investment is based on thorough research and a balanced portfolio. Instead of going after popular stocks, you should invest in companies with strong fundamentals, good corporate governance, and long-term profitability. A diversified portfolio across sectors and regions is critical to minimize risks. Regular monitoring and balancing of your portfolio based on market conditions and personal financial goals are also necessary.
