This is a financial fallacy because it assumes that by skipping regular health checkups, you're saving money. In fact, the opposite is true. Regular health checkups can help detect health issues early when they are more manageable and less expensive to treat. For example, the cost of treating diseases like cancer at an advanced stage is typically far higher than regular screenings that could have detected it earlier.

Besides, untreated health issues also lead to loss of productivity, which could impact your income and financial well-being in the long-run. Additionally, some insurance covers preventive screenings and regular checkups, meaning you're not using benefits you're already paying for if you skip those.

The correct financial behavior would be to take advantage of regular health checkups and screenings as an investment in one's overall financial and health future. Being proactive about your health can potentially save you significant healthcare costs in the future.
