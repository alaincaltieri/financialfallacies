The financial fallacy: "Investing in an expensive education for your children should be the utmost priority" is often misleading because it's based on the assumption that a high-cost education will automatically result in success in life. However, this is not always the case. Many successful people didn't attend prestigious, expensive schools, and many who did are not as successful in their careers as expected. Furthermore, undue pressure to finance an expensive education may lead to substantial financial stress. 

The correct financial behavior is to consider education as an investment and analyze it from a value perspective. It's prudent to examine all the factors, like the success rate of graduates, the specialty of the institution, scholarship opportunities, among others before making a financial commitment of this magnitude. It's also essential to find a balance between the quality of education and the amount of debt that either you or your child will have to bear.
