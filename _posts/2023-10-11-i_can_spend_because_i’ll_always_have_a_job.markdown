This perception is a financial fallacy due to the unpredictability of job security. Economic downturns, industry disruptions, corporate downsizing, health issues, and many other factors might jeopardize employment at any time (Spiceland, J.D., Sepe, J., & Nelson, M. 2013). Additionally, such an attitude can lead to poor money management and high levels of debt.

The correct financial behavior involves being mindful of one's spending habits, setting aside savings from every paycheck, investing wisely, and creating an emergency fund that can cover at least three to six months of living expenses in the event of job loss or unforeseen emergencies (Atlas, C., & Atkinson, L. 2015), (Chatzky, J. 2016).
