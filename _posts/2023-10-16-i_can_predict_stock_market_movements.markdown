Assuming that one can predict stock market movements is a financial fallacy mainly because of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that stock prices fully reflect all available information and rapid adjustments occur when new information becomes available. This means that it's nearly impossible to consistently outperform the market, or "beat the market," on a risk-adjusted basis, given the current available information (Fama, 1970).

Despite well-documented patterns in returns and famous investors seemingly beating the market, consistent success in this field remains elusive. Numerous studies, including Malkiel & Fama (1970), have shown that active fund managers and individual investors underperform standard benchmarks.

Further readings include "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel to get a more profound understanding of EMH and stock market randomness.

The correct financial behaviour is to adopt a long-term, diversified investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance. This could include a mix of low-cost index funds or ETFs, which tend to match market performances over the long run (Bogle, 1999). Regular investments through a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging can also limit the impact of market volatility. Consulting with a certified financial advisor is also a good idea to ensure a strategy that fits with personal financial goals.
