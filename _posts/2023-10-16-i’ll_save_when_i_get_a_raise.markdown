The notion "I’ll save when I get a raise" is a financial fallacy mainly due to two reasons; lifestyle inflation and procrastination. Lifestyle inflation refers to increasing one's spending when income rises, leading to no extra money left for savings. Also, delaying saving is a form of procrastination that assumes future money is guaranteed, which might not be the case due to uncertainties.

The correct financial behavior is to start saving as soon as possible, no matter how small the amount. This can be done by setting aside a certain percentage of your income towards savings every time you're paid - a method known as 'paying yourself first'.
