Investing solely in the company you work for is considered a financial fallacy mainly due to two risks - lack of diversification and concentration of risk. 

Lack of Diversification: This means that instead of spreading your investments across different sectors, industries, or companies to manage risk, you are entirely dependent on one company's performance (Investopedia, 2020). If the company fails, your investments can severely decline. This is against the key concept of portfolio diversification in investment (Turner, 2020).

Concentration of Risk: If you work for a company and also invest heavily in its stocks, your financial well-being is heavily tied to that one company. If the company encounters difficulties or goes bust, not only is your job at risk, but your investments would decline in value as well (Hargreaves Lansdown, 2017).

Correct Financial Behaviour:
The correct financial behaviour would be to diversify your investment portfolio. Diversification involves spreading your investments across various assets (like shares, bonds, property) or different sectors to spread the risk. You can still invest a portion in your company, but that shouldn't be your only investment. This helps to minimize the risk of a single investment or asset class drastically impacting your overall financial health. Furthermore, speak with a financial advisor to fully understand your risk tolerance and craft an individualized investment strategy.
