This financial fallacy stems from the misunderstanding of how the value of luxury goods fluctuates over time. It may be true that some luxury items can increase in value, yet most depreciate over time, often suffering significant declines as soon as they are purchased, because theyâ€™re no longer new!

According to Investopedia, Depreciation refers to the decrease in value of an asset over time, particularly due to wear and tear. This applies to luxury items such as high-end watches, cars, and designer clothing (Investopedia, n.d.). Furthermore, the market for luxury items is dependent on trends and tastes which can shift quickly and unpredictably, further making it hard to resell items for a profit.

For more information on this, refer to:
1. "Understanding how assets depreciate" by Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp
2. "Why Luxury Brands Aren't Worth the Cost" by U.S. News: https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/why-luxury-brands-arent-worth-the-cost

In terms of the correct financial behavior, it's always recommended to live within your means. Frugality, budgeting, investing wisely, and avoiding non-essential, expensive purchases, especially those bought with the hope of reselling later, are key principles of good personal finance management. For further reading, the book "Your Money or Your Life" by Vicki Robin offers great insights into how to manage money wisely.

Remember, the value of money spent should be truly realised not just monetarily but also in terms of fulfillment and satisfaction derived from the usage of the items purchased.
