Believing that you should only invest in actively managed mutual funds can be a financially unsound idea due to management fees, transaction costs, and the fact that most actively managed funds do not consistently outperform the market. Actively managed funds try to beat market averages, but according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, nearly 83% of them failed to do so over a 10-year period (Benz, 2019).

Actively managed mutual funds often incur higher expenses such as high management fees and transaction costs which eat away at the fundsâ€™ return. This is due to the high level of trading these types of funds engage in, which can also generate potential tax liabilities for investors (Investor.gov).

Instead, it may be prudent to invest in a combination of actively managed funds and passively managed funds (like index funds or ETFs), which are designed to match the performance of a specific index, based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. This diversified approach can help balance the potential for higher returns against the risk of higher fees and underperformance.

Good financial behavior involves diversifying your investments across different asset classes, having a long-term perspective, regularly reviewing your investment portfolio and adjusting your investments based on your changing financial goals and market conditions. Working with a trusted financial advisor can also be beneficial.
