The financial fallacy here is a concept known as "home bias". It refers to the tendency for investors to lean toward investing heavily or solely in domestic companies, sometimes to the detriment of diversification. While patriotism might prompt some to invest in their local economy, financial decisions should be guided by individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the pursuit of diversified investments. 

Over-investing in domestic companies presents the risk of not being adequately diversified. For example, if a country's economy takes a downturn, the investor's portfolio could suffer heavily. On the other hand, international diversification allows investors to spread their risk across various economies, increase potential returns and decrease investment risk.

The correct financial behaviour should involve an understanding of the need for a diversified portfolio. This means spreading investments across different asset classes and geographies rather than investing excessively in one area. Diversification potentially offers a level of protection against financial losses because the poor performance of some investments will likely be offset by the acceptable performance of others.
