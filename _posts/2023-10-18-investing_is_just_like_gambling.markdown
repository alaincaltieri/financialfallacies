Saying "Investing is just like gambling" is an oversimplification and thus, a financial fallacy. In gambling, the outcome is determined purely by luck or chance, with the odds usually stacked against the player. Effective investing, on the other hand, is a long-term process based on careful research, risk assessment, disciplined strategy, and understanding of market trends. The risk in investing can be minimized and systematic, unlike the inherent uncertainty in gambling.

Correct financial behavior involves informed decision-making, understanding your risk tolerance, diversification of investments, continuous learning, patience, and being proactive but disciplined with investments. Regular monitoring and evaluating of your investment portfolio is also a crucial part of mastery in financial behavior.
