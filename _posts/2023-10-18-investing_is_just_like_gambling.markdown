Saying "Investing is just like gambling" is an oversimplification and thus, a financial fallacy. In gambling, the outcome is determined purely by luck or chance, with the odds usually stacked against the player. Effective investing, on the other hand, is a long-term process based on careful research, risk assessment, disciplined strategy, and understanding of market trends. The risk in investing can be minimized and systematic, unlike the inherent uncertainty in gambling.

Now empathy is crucial here, because it's easy to see and understand why people would think investing is just like gambling. Both can be perceived as high-risk activities, with the potential to lose all your initial outlay. Media often glamorizes both fields, highlighting stories of people becoming millionaires overnight. On top of this is our natural human tendency to fear the unknown. For someone not acquainted with the stock market, the ups and downs can feel alarmingly unpredictable. 

Correct financial behavior involves informed decision-making, understanding your risk tolerance, diversification of investments, continuous learning, patience, and being proactive but disciplined with investments. Regular monitoring and evaluating of your investment portfolio is also a crucial part of mastery in financial behavior.
