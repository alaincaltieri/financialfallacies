This assertion is a financial fallacy because success is not solely determined by higher education. While a college degree might increase the chances of gaining certain high-paying careers, there are other pathways to success. Some of the worldâ€™s most successful entrepreneurs, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg & Steve Jobs, left school without a degree, yet they have achieved monumental success (Lorenz, T., 2019).

Moreover, a degree often comes with significant study loans that need to be paid off for many years. In a report by the Federal Reserve, the average monthly student loan payment in 2019 was between $200-$299 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2019). This can be a heavy financial burden and may hinder the ability to save money and invest in other areas.

The correct financial behavior is to live within your means, save for the future, and invest intelligently, regardless of your level of education. Developing a habit of regular saving and investing, good budgeting skills, and ability to earn income (either from a job, business, or investments) are key to financial success (Kenton, W., 2020).
