The idea that "I can save by skipping regular health checkups" is a financial fallacy because it overlooks the potential long-term costs involved. While skipping regular health checkups may save you a small amount of money in the near term, it could lead to higher medical expenses in the future if a health issue that could have been caught and addressed early becomes a serious problem.

The correct financial behavior in this situation would be seeing regular checkups as an investment in your future health and well-being. By regularly keeping track of your health status through checkups, you reduce the risk of serious, and often expensive, health issues developing unnoticed. If an issue is found, early treatment is usually more effective and less costly than treatment at more advanced stages.
