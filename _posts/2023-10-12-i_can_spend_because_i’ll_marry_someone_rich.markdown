This belief is considered a financial fallacy because it depends on several uncertain factors. Relying on others, in this case, a wealthy partner, for financial stability is risky as it isn't guaranteed. It also lacks financial independence and discredits personal financial responsibilities.

Firstly, the prospect of marrying a wealthy individual is not a certainty for most people. Secondly, even within a wealthy marriage, financial difficulties can arise such as divorce, death, or bad investments leading to significant loss of wealth. Lastly, the assumption promotes financial dependence rather than encouraging financial literacy and personal growth in managing one's financial affairs (Mitchell, 1993).

The correct financial behaviour is to establish your own financial stability. This includes planning your expenditures, having a savings plan, investing wisely to grow your wealth, and constantly educating yourself on financial literacy. Aiming to be financially independent does not only offer you security, it also gives you freedom to make your own life choices (Kiyosaki, 2000).
