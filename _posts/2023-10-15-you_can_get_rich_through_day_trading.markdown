Day trading refers to the practice of buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day. This activity is often romantically portrayed as a quick and surefire path to wealth, but the reality is often far different. Getting rich through day trading is indeed a financial fallacy for several reasons:

1. Statistical Disadvantage: According to a research paper issued by University of California, Berkeley titled "Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?", it's stated that "the vast majority of day traders will lose money due to transaction costs, bid-ask spread, and other market microstructure costs." 

2. High-Risk Factor: Day trading is inherently risky due to market volatility. A study from Brazil stated in the Journal of Applied Finance found that "only about 3% of day traders earned a net profit year over year and most of these successful day traders were in the game for just one day."

3. Psychological challenges: Day trading often involves impulsive decisions under stress which can lead to mistakes.

The correct financial behavior would be diversifying your portfolio over a variety of investments, and adopting a long-term, patient approach to investing. This is supported by research from Vanguard that shows over a 10-year period, 87% of day traders lost money, whereas long term investing consistently results in a positive return.
