Dependence on a partner’s financial management is a financial fallacy because it puts you in a vulnerable position if your partner cannot maintain their income, becomes incapacitated, or if the relationship ends. Moreover, it disregards the personal in personal finance, where one should engage in financial planning based on individual circumstances and goals. (Reference: Kapur, N. (2017). Women’s Financial Literacy and the Role of Marital Control. Journal of Consumer Affairs, 51(2), 445–472. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/joca.12125)

The correct financial behaviour is to take an active role in financial decision-making and invest time into understanding money management. One approach could be aligning both partners' financial goals and working together while maintaining each partner’s financial independence. Investment products like retirement savings should be personalized and diversified as per each partner's investment goals. Budgeting, contingency planning, and financial literacy should be a focus irrespective of one's relationship status.
