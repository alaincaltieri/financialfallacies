This is a financial fallacy because assuming you're too old to start saving for retirement can discourage you from maximizing your remaining income earning years. Even if you've reached middle or older age, there are a number of retirement plans and investment opportunities that can yield significant returns in shorter periods of time (AARP, 2020).

Additionally, due to compound interest, even smaller amounts saved at a later stage can grow significantly, especially since retirement funds often remain invested for several years including post retirement (Kiplinger, 2021). 

A better financial behavior would be to start saving and investing immediately, regardless of your age. Even if you're closer to retirement, contributing to a retirement plan provides tax advantages, and potential employer matching contributions additionally offer free money.
