The statement: "You should invest in cryptocurrencies" as a universal truth, is a financial fallacy because it neglects the vital principles of risk tolerance, investment goals, financial literacy, and diversification. 

1. Volatility and Risk: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can present a significant risk, especially for novice investors or those who cannot afford potential losses (source: Investopedia).

2. Lack of Regulation: These digital assets lack strong regulatory control and oversight, which paves the way for potential manipulative practices and fraud (source: Forbes).

3. No Intrinsic Value: Unlike stocks or bonds, cryptocurrencies do not yield dividends or interest, and their value depends highly on speculative demand (source: Bloomberg).

For further readings, consider:
1. "Cryptocurrency: A New Investment Opportunity?" by Momtaz (2020) in the Journal of Corporate Finance.
2. "Decoding Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin" by Invector Global.

Correct financial behavior involves:

1. Diversification: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification helps to mitigate risk (source: CNBC).

2. Financial Knowledge: Understanding the fundamentals of any asset or investment option before investing (source: SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy).

3. Assessing Risk Tolerance: Consider your personal financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance before making any investment decision (source: U.S. SEC).

4. Seeking Professional Advice: If unsure, consider seeking advice from financial advisors or professionals (source: Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA).

Every individual's situation varies, and while cryptocurrencies might be a suitable investment for some, they might not be for everyone. Proper research, prudent judgment, and sometimes expert advice are integral to financial success.
