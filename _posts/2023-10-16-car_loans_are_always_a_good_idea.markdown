The statement that "Car loans are always a good idea" is a financial fallacy due to a number of reasons:

1. Interest Costs: Car loans are typically accompanied by interest payments over the term of the loan, which means you're paying more than the actual price for the vehicle (Clark, 2020).

2. Depreciation: Cars depreciate in value quickly. So, you might still be paying off your car loan long after the vehicle’s value has declined significantly (The Balance, 2020).

3. Potential for Negative Equity: If the car’s value decreases faster than you repay your loan, you could end up owing more than the car is worth (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2017).

Correct Financial Behavior:

Purchasing a car outright, if you can afford it, is generally financially wiser as you avoid paying interest. If a car loan is unavoidable, it's crucial to consider the interest rate, the length of the loan, and the reliability and cost of the car itself. An option would be to consider a less expensive car, or save for a larger down payment to reduce the loan amount. Budget appropriately to pay off your car loan as swiftly as possible to minimize the interest cost.
