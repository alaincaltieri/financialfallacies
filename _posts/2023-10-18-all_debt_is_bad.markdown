This statement is a common financial fallacy because it simplifies the nature of debt, failing to differentiate between its different forms and uses. Not all debt is created equal. There are two main types of debt: good debt and bad debt. Good debt, in proper moderation, can represent a strategic investment that brings a return over time. Examples include a student loan for a degree that enhances earning potential, a mortgage for a home that appreciates in value, or a business loan to expand a company promising high returns.

The correct financial behaviour revolves around effective debt management. It's about understanding the difference between good and bad debts, using good debt to your advantage, and avoiding or managing bad debts. Good money management also implies keeping your debt within manageable limits, saving and investing wisely, maintaining good credit, and planning for the future.
