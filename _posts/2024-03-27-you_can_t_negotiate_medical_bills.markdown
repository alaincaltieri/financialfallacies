Assuming that you cannot negotiate medical bills is indeed a financial fallacy. While the prices on them might seem fixed or non-negotiable, that isn't actually the case. Like many bills, medical bills can often be negotiated down, either by discussing the matter directly with the hospital or healthcare provider or by hiring an expert to do so on your behalf. This misconception may arise from the often complex, confusing nature of healthcare billing and the common belief that charges are standardized. 

Medical financing can be complex and daunting, creating a natural intimidation against questioning the cost. Furthermore, many people are not aware that healthcare providers often inflate prices, expecting to negotiate with insurance companies. People also assume professional pricing is fixed, which is not the case. It's important to recognize that financial barriers should not prevent anyone from seeking essential medical care. Also, similar to other sectors where negotiating is uncommon, individuals may feel uncomfortable or risk offending their healthcare providers.

The correct financial behavior is to not accept these bills at face value without questioning. When you receive a medical bill, it's critical to review it closely for any mistakes and fair pricing. If the bills seem too high, it's important to not hesitate in negotiating with the healthcare providers or the billing department. In some cases, they may offer a payment plan and in others, they could reduce the overall bill. However, remember to get any changes in the payment or pricing in writing.
