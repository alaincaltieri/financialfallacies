The idea that insurance is a waste of money is a financial fallacy because it assumes that unexpected disastrous events won't occur. The main purpose of insurance is to protect individuals from potential significant financial loss and it provides a level of financial security (Investopedia). Insurance plans, ranging from health to life to home owner's insurance, are essential financial tools that protect against unforeseen and potentially devastating events (CNBC).

Insurance is an investment in mitigating the financial risk associated with disastrous events. Although one might pay insurance premiums for many years without making a claim, the financial protection provided when something does happen (e.g., a serious illness, death, or severe property damage), could far outweigh years of premium payments (Queensland Government).

The correct financial behavior is to understand that insurance is not a waste, but a necessity in sound financial planning. One should consistently evaluate their insurance needs based on changes in their life, such as family growth, property acquisition or career advancement. This ensures their coverage stays proportional to their potential financial risks, thereby avoiding under or over-insuring. It is also important to regularly compare insurance providers to make sure they're getting the best deal for their coverage needs.
