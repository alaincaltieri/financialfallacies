The statement, 'I’ll save when I’m older and have fewer expenses,' is a financial fallacy for several reasons. Firstly, it assumes that your future self will have the ability to save more than your current self, which is not always guaranteed. Second, it overlooks the power of compound interest, which works more effectively the earlier you start saving. Time is your ally when it comes to personal savings and investments.

Correct financial behaviour involves prioritizing savings and investments from an early age or as soon as you start earning. Even small amounts, when invested wisely, can grow significantly over time due to compound interest. Budgeting, responsible spending, and embracing a lifestyle within one's means is also part of correct financial behaviour. Regularly reassessing your personal finance strategy to ensure alignment with your financial goals should also be emphasized.
