This argument is considered a financial fallacy because it presumes guaranteed high returns on the assumption that the "up and coming" neighborhood will continue growing in value, which is speculative and risky. Real estate markets can be volatile and unpredictable due to many socio-economic factors such as changes in employment rates, community developments, interest rates, and the global economy (Lindblad, M. R., & Xiao, J. J., 2014).

Moreover, gentrification (redevelopment in a formerly low-income area) does not always result in increased property values. Sometimes, cultural and social resistance can negatively impact the expected growth (Barton, M., 2016).

Proper financial behavior would involve a thorough analysis of housing affordability, personal financial stability, and potential return on investment. It is also crucial to consider non-financial factors such as convenience and personal lifestyle needs.
