The saying "you need a lot of money to start investing" is a financial fallacy because investing can be initiated with any amount, and your investment can grow over time. Certain platforms allow investors to start with as little as $5, enabling them to buy fractional shares of more expensive stocks (Roose, K (2015). New Apps for the Frugal-minded and the Invested. The New York Times).

Investing small amounts consistently performs better in the long term as it takes advantage of a strategy called dollar-cost averaging. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility by dividing your total investment over periodic purchases of a target asset (Investopedia).

The correct financial behaviour is to start investing the moment you have money beyond your basic needs and emergency savings, regardless of the amount. As Warren Buffett, a well-known investor, stated "Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving."

Some useful reads for further understanding include:
1. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C. Bogle
2. A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel

Remember, the goal of investing is not just to make a profit but also to save and grow your money for long-term goals, such as retirement, college tuition, or a house down payment.
