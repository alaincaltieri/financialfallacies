This statement is a financial fallacy because the cost of education does not necessarily equate to its value or potential return on investment. An expensive education can result in significant student debt, which might not be worth it if the expected income after graduation cannot service this debt. Moreover, there are other avenues for learning that can provide a good education at much lower costs, such as state or community colleges, trade schools, or online learning platforms.

Correct financial behaviour involves carefully evaluating the cost versus the benefit of any major investment, including education. This involves analyzing the career outlook for a particular field of study, understanding the implications of taking on significant student debt, and considering more affordable alternatives. Furthermore, investing in education should be a part of a larger financial plan that includes saving, investing, and debt management.
