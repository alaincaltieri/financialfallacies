The belief that car loans are necessary to build credit is a financial fallacy primarily due to the belief that there are no other methods to boost one's credit. It's crucial to remember that car loans, like any other form of debt, can have both positive and negative impacts on your credit score. For instance, if you promptly pay your car loan, it can positively impact your credit. However, if payments are missed, this can put a dent in your credit score. Furthermore, taking out a car loan means that you're committing to paying interest which isnâ€™t necessarily beneficial to your financial health if not necessary.

Credit can be built in a variety of ways that do not involve taking on an auto loan or any significant debt. For instance, responsible use of a credit card, paying utility bills on time, and small personal loans can also build credit. Maintaining a healthy mix of credit, paying all dues on time, and keeping your credit utilization rate low are some of the practices that help build good credit score.
