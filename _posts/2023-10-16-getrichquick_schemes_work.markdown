This is a financial fallacy because gaining wealth typically involves a diligent, long-term approach — namely, consistent saving, making smart investments, and ensuring your money earns interests over time. Get-rich-quick schemes often involve risky, shady, and even illegal activities. The majority who participate in these schemes often end up losing money, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Here are a few references and further readings that emphasize this viewpoint:
1. "Beware of Pyramid Schemes Posing as Multi-Level Marketing Programs" – Federal Trade Commission
2. "Investment Fraud: How To Protect Your Money" – American Association of Retired Persons
3. "The Truth About Getting Rich Quick" – Dave Ramsey

The correct financial behaviour includes saving and investing wisely for the long term. Developing a diverse portfolio can help mitigate risk. You should also consistently educate yourself about personal finance and follow strong financial habits, like budgeting, reading financial statements, reducing debt, and being wary of where you put your money. 

For further reading on this behaviour:
1. "The Total Money Makeover: Classic Edition: A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness" by Dave Ramsey
2. "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns" by John C. Bogle
3. "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey, which while not purely a finance book, offers paradigms on effectiveness that can be applied to financial dealings.
