The financial fallacy of "borrowing your way out of debt" is based on the misconception that taking on more debt can make existing debt go away. This can lead to a cycle of continuous borrowing, where the repayments become increasingly unmanageable.

First, borrowing more money will just increase your overall debt and erect larger interest costs (NerdWallet). Second, you're merely shifting your debt, not mitigating it. While it's true that some people may find short-term relief through debt consolidation loans or balance transfers, those strategies only work if you can secure a lower interest rate and manage to pay off your new loan responsibly.

The correct way to deal with debt is to formulate a budget and a repayment plan. Identifying where your money goes and how much can be allocated to pay off your debts is crucial (ASIC, moneysmart). That plan should include tech-savvy solutions like automated payments to ensure timely bill payment. Another directly useful habit would be keeping your credit card usage in check to avoid piling on more debt.
