Believing "I can depend on my partner's financial management" is a financial fallacy due to several reasons:

1. Personal Responsibility: Relying solely on someone else for financial management relinquishes personal responsibility. Individual financial behaviour and knowledge are pivotal for financial security.

2. Risk of Disagreements: Money is often an area of contention among partners. Depending on your partner entirely for financial matters might contribute to potential clashes and disagreements.

3. Change in Circumstance: Circumstances can change swiftly. From relationship breakdowns to the sudden death of your partner, these situations demand personal financial vigilance and ability.

The correct financial behavior encapsulates:

1. Financial Literacy: Make an effort to understand the basic concepts of finance including investing, budgeting, taxation, and retirement planning.

2. Co-management: Financial decision making should be a shared responsibility in a partnership. Discuss and establish financial goals together.

3. Personal Savings: Always have personal savings apart from the shared ones. This creates an additional safety net for any unexpected financial plunge.
