Believing a credit card alone makes a suitable emergency fund is a financial fallacy for several reasons:

1. High Interest Rates: Credit cards typically come with high-interest rates, meaning any balance not paid off immediately can increase rapidly (Investopedia).

2. Dependence on Credit: Relying solely on a credit card can push you further into debt and create an unhealthy dependence on credit.

3. Limited Funds: Credit card limits are inadequate for big emergencies. Card limits may be too low and may not cover significant costs such as prolonged medical expenses or major car repairs (NerdWallet).

4. Negative Impact on Credit Score: Maxing out your credit card can negatively impact your credit score (Experian). 

Therefore, the correct financial behavior is to build an actual emergency fund, separate from any credit or loan accounts.

1. Start Small: It can be as little as $500 to $1,000 to begin with. 

2. The Ideal Size: Most experts suggest growing it to cover 3-6 months of basic living expenses. 

3. Separate Account: Keep it in a separate, easily accessible account, ideally a high-yield savings account for better growing potential (CNBC Make It). 

4. Gradual Accumulation: Keep depositing regularly until your fund reaches the goal.
