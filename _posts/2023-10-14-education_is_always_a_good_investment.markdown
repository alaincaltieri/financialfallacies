The fallacy "Education is always a good investment" operates on the assumption that any type of education, in any field, at any cost, will inevitably yield a positive return on investment. Although it's undeniable that education can generally increase earning potential and opportunities, it is not always financially beneficial in every scenario. Several factors can influence the value of an educational investment including your chosen field of study, the cost of education, the prestige of the educational institution, and the time it takes to complete the degree.

In calculating the return on investment (ROI) for education, both direct costs (tuition, books, fees) and indirect costs (opportunity costs such as potential income foregone by attending school instead of working) need to be considered. Depending on these factors, the debt acquired from education may outweigh the financial benefits gained, rendering it a poor investment.

The correct financial behaviour in relation to education would be conducting a full cost-benefit analysis before investing in it. This includes researching potential earning prospects in your chosen field, calculating total education cost, considering the time to graduation, and exploring options for scholarships or financial aid. It's also important to consider non-financial benefits or costs such as interest in the field or job satisfaction.
