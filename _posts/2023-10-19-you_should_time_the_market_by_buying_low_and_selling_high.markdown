The financial fallacy revolves around the idea of "timing the market" â€“ buying low and selling high. On paper, this strategy seems like a foolproof way to maximize returns. However, in reality, consistently executing the strategy is nearly impossible. This is primarily due to the unpredictability of market movements and the emotional variables involved in investing decisions.

Market timing requires accurate predictions of market peaks (for selling) and troughs (for buying). This level of foresight is something even experienced financial professionals struggle to consistently achieve. Unforeseeable factors like political events, economic policies and global crises can dramatically affect the markets. This unpredictability highlights the risk of trying to time the market.

Furthermore, decisions to buy or sell often get influenced by emotions such as fear during a downturn or greed during an upswing. These emotional decisions often lead to buying high and selling low, contrary to the intended strategy.

The more sound financial behaviour is a long-term, disciplined investment strategy. This approach often includes "dollar-cost averaging" where a fixed dollar amount is regularly invested regardless of market conditions. This strategy reduces the risk of large losses from ill-timed investments, while potentially lowering the average cost per share over time. Portfolio diversification is also key, as it spreads risk across various industries, geographies and asset classes, reducing potential losses.
