The financial fallacy "Keeping up with the Joneses" refers to the practice of maintaining a lifestyle or a consumption level that's comparable or even superior to one's peers or neighbors. It's a fallacy because it leads one to make financial decisions based on others' spending habits, rather than their own financial capacity or goals. This approach can result in overspending, financial strain, and debt.

The correct financial behavior is to focus on one's own financial goals and limitations, rather than attempting to keep pace with others. This involves budgeting responsibly, saving regularly, managing debts wisely, and investing for the future. It's a more sustainable, long-term financial strategy that considers personal financial health and wellbeing over societal perceptions or immediate gratification.
