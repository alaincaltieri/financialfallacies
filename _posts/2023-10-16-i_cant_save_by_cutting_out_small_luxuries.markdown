The financial fallacy here is underestimating the impact of small, frequent expenses on overall financial health. These "small luxuries," whether daily lattes or monthly magazine subscriptions, can add up significantly over time.

For instance, let's say you spend $5 a day on a coffee. If you cut out that one luxury, you would save $1,825 a year. Put into a savings account over time, this could turn into a significant amount due to compounding interest.

This concept is highlighted in the book "The Latte Factor: Why You Don't Have to be Rich to Live Rich" by David Bach. He discusses the "Latte Factor", the idea that eliminating small, unnecessary expenses can lead to substantial savings over time.

Correct financial behavior involves being mindful of all expenses, big or small, and understanding their long-term implications. This doesn't necessarily mean cutting out all small luxuries, but being more conscious about these purchases and ensuring they fit into a larger budget.
