The concept "I can spend now and save later" is a financial fallacy because it ignores the power of compound interest, encourages poor money habits, and may lead to financial instability in the future. It's based on the flawed assumption that income will inevitably increase in the future and fails to account for unexpected expenses or economic downturns.

According to Albert Einstein, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world" (Investopedia). Compound interest involves earning interest on both the initial money saved (the principal) and the interest already accrued. The earlier you start saving, the more time there is for interest to compound, leading to significantly greater wealth over time. Delaying savings can thus result in substantially less monetary growth (The Balance).

The behaviour also encourages a 'buy now, pay later' mentality. Establishing good financial habits, like budgeting, saving, and investing, early on is crucial for long-term financial health (Forbes).

Finally, saving later assumes steady future income and no unexpected expensesâ€”both unreliable assumptions. Emergencies or job losses can occur unexpectedly, and having saved money can help weather such financial storms (NerdWallet).

The correct financial behaviour is to start saving and investing as early as possible to benefit from the power of compound interest. You should also establish good financial habits including budgeting and living within your means. Building an emergency fund is also essential for financial security.
