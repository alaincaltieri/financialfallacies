This statement is a financial fallacy because it assumes that wealth can be achieved quickly and easily, which is rarely ever the case. A majority of these schemes are often dishonest or fraudulent, preying on individuals' desire for quick financial gain. Even if some appear to be legitimate, they usually carry high risk, and the chances of losing your investment are high. Moreover, these schemes often require constant influx of new recruits or funds - as in the case of a pyramid scheme - in order to maintain the illusion of profitability. As the scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain, and those who enter late or cannot recruit others often end up losing their investment. This is why they are largely considered unsustainable and unreliable.

Now, onto the correct financial behaviour:

Instead of falling for quick schemes, the correct approach towards financial growth is consistency, patience, and wise decisions. This may involve setting clear financial goals, spending within your means, saving and investing wisely, building emergency funds, and planning for retirement. It often includes seeking advice from financial professionals. Also, financial literacy is important; understanding the basics of personal finance like the compounding interest, how credit works and the basics of taxation can significantly improve one's financial wellbeing.
