The statement "You need a high income to be financially secure" is a common financial fallacy. While a high income can certainly provide a head start towards financial stability, it doesn't guarantee it. The reason is that financial security doesn't depend solely on how much money you earn, but rather how you manage, save, invest and spend it. Earning a high income but squandering it on uncontrolled expenses, or failing to properly invest and save for the future, can lead to financial instability. On the other hand, a moderate income, when coupled with prudent financial decisions like budgeting, investing and saving, can provide significant financial security.

The correct financial behaviour involves responsible financial management. This includes forming a clear understanding of your income and expenses, creating a realistic budget, saving a portion of your income regularly, investing wisely for long-term growth, guarding against risk with suitable insurance policies, and avoiding high interest debt. It also involves continual financial education to make informed decisions.
