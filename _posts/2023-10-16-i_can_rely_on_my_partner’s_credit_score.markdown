Relying solely on your partner's credit score is a financial fallacy because credit scores are individually determined and utilized. According to Experian, one of the three major credit bureaus, everyone has their own credit score. Not even marriage causes a merging of credit scores (Experian, n.d.). 

Your partner’s score can affect joint financial activities such as applying for a mortgage, but lenders may still look at both credit histories before approving any credit. Furthermore, in the event of a separation, you cannot rely on your partner's credit. 

The right financial behaviour would be to aim for each person to establish strong, independent credit scores. Each person should make timely payments, use credit responsibly, and monitor their credit report for any inaccuracies.
