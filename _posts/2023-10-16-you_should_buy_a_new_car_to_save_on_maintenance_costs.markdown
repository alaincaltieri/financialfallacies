Buying a new car to save on maintenance costs is a financial fallacy for several reasons. 

Firstly, new cars depreciate quickly. According to Carfax, a car loses 10% of its value the moment it's driven off the lot and another 10% during the first year. Over five years, it can lose 60% or more of its initial value (1).

Secondly, while new cars may have fewer maintenance issues initially, they do come with higher insurance premiums and possibly higher registration costs compared to used cars (2).

Furthermore, many used cars are still reliable and may come with warranties. Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles, for example, go through rigorous inspections and come with extended warranties from the manufacturer.

In terms of correct financial behaviour, it would generally be more cost-effective to maintain and repair a used car than buy a new one. You should also be saving money consistently for car-related expenses, whether that's for repairs, insurance, or eventually replacing your car. 

Additionally, consider the total cost of ownership, which includes not just the purchase price, but also depreciation, interest on your loan, taxes and fees, insurance premiums, fuel costs, maintenance, and repairs (3). 

The final decision should be based on careful consideration of your financial situation, lifestyle needs, and personal preferences.
