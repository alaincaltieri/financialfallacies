The 4% rule, popularized in the 1990s by financial advisor William Bengen, suggests that if you withdraw 4% of your retirement savings each year, your savings should last 30 years. However, multiple factors can make this rule fallible:

1. Market Volatility: The 4% rule assumes static market returns, ignoring unpredictable market fluctuations. In reality, the stock market can fluctify significantly, and this can affect the sustainability of your withdrawals (Kitces, 2008).

2. Changes in lifestyles/Needs: The rule can't account for changes in personal circumstances, lifestyle needs, or unexpected healthcare costs.

3. Historic data: The 4% rule is based on financial models and historic data. This doesn't guarantee future market conditions (Evensky, 2008).

4. It doesn't account for inflation: The growing inflation rate can degrade your purchasing power, reducing the amount you can live on.

5. Longevity risk: If you lived past 30 years of retirement, you might outlive your savings if only following the 4% rule.

As for the correct financial behaviour:

1. Flexible Spending: Rather than withdrawing a fixed rate, consider a flexible spending approach, adjusting annually based on your portfolio performance and market conditions.

2. Diversify your Investments: To secure different income streams and mitigate market risks.

3. Regular Review: Regularly revisit your retirement plan, reacting appropriately to market changes, life changes and inflation.

4. Proper Health Care Planning: Consider future healthcare costs in your retirement planning.

5. Expert Help: Consult a financial advisor to create a tailored plan matching your lifestyle and expectations for retirement.
