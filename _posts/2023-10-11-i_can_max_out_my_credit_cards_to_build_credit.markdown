The idea that maxing out your cards will build good credit is a financial fallacy. While credit card usage can contribute to credit history and score, maxing out cards typically leads to high credit utilization ratio, which negatively impacts credit scores. Sustainably managing your credit, by keeping a low credit utilization ratio (below 30%), is advised by most experts. 

Additionally, maxing out credit cards can lead to hefty interest payments if balances are not paid in full, leading to a costly debt cycle.

Correct Financial Behaviour: 
The correct behaviour would be to use the credit card responsibly, keeping the balance low and paying it off in full each month. Doing so illustrates healthy financial habits and can lead to an improved credit score. Also, maintaining a diverse portfolio of credit—like home loans, auto loans, and student loans—can show you can handle various types of credit.
