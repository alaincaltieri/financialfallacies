Hype and media coverage do not necessarily predict the economic performance of a company. This is a financial fallacy because economic performance is determined by a multitude of factors, including sales, expenses, assets, liabilities, and the overall health of the industry and economy, not publicity (Investopedia, n.d.). Additionally, media coverage can be misleading because it often focuses on sensational news, which may not accurately reflect the company's operations or financial situation (Appinventiv, 2020).

The correct financial behaviour is to rely on comprehensive financial analysis, such as studying the company's financial reports (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements), industry trends, and economic indicators. This should be accompanied by a balanced assessment of qualitative factors such as company management and competitive positioning. Personal sentiments and media hype should not cloud one's judgment while making investment decisions. Expert advice should also be sought when necessary. 

Moreover, diversifying investments to manage and spread risk is a sound financial practice recommended by most financial advisors, as stated by Graham, J. R., & Smart, S. B. in their book "Introduction to Corporate Finance".
