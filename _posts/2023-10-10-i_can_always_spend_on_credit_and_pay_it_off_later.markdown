The idea that one can always spend on credit and pay it off later is a financial fallacy because of several reasons: 

1. Risk of Debt: Spending on credit increases the risk of falling into debt. If you're unable to pay off your balance in full each month, you'll be charged interest, which can add up quickly (Investopedia, 2021). 

2. High interest: Credit cards typically have high interest rates. If you're only making the minimum payments, it could take years to pay off your debt and you could end up paying a lot more than the original amount (CNBC, 2018).

3. Credit Score: Continually carrying a high balance can negatively impact your credit score. The higher your credit utilization rate, the worse it is for your score (Experian, 2020).

4. False perception of wealth: Credit cards can create a false sense of financial security and promote overspending (Nerdwallet, 2017).

Correct Financial Behavior:
The more financially responsible approach is to spend within your means, i.e., not spending more than you earn. It's also prudent to save and invest money for future needs and emergencies. If you use credit, aim to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges and protect your credit score. Lastly, create a budget to track your income and expenses, which can help curb overspending.
